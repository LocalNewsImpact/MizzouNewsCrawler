**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

## Deployment Summary

### Build Details
- **Build ID:** `1138b5fe-2895-4910-a5b4-a014785344b2`
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Commit:** `72e394c` (includes proxy telemetry + zsh curl fixes)
- **Image:** `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mizzou-news-crawler/mizzou-crawler/processor:72e394c`
- **Build Time:** 2025-10-10 01:33:42 UTC

### Deployment Details
- **Release:** `processor-72e394c`
- **Rollout (1st attempt):** `processor-72e394c-to-production-0001` - ‚ùå FAILED
  - **Failure Reason:** CPU resource exhaustion, liveness probe timeout
  - **Error:** `Liveness probe errored: "python -c import sys; sys.exit(0)" timed out after 10s`
  - **Cluster Issue:** `0/2 nodes available: 2 Insufficient cpu`

- **Rollout (2nd attempt):** `processor-72e394c-to-production-0002` - ‚úÖ SUCCESS
  - **Time:** 2025-10-10 12:32:14 UTC
  - **Duration:** ~30 seconds
  - **Method:** Temporary resource scaling (cost-free solution)

### Cost-Free Deployment Solution Applied

**Problem:** GKE cluster (2x e2-medium nodes, 2 CPU each) was at capacity during deployment.

**Solution (No Permanent Cost Increase):**
1. Scaled down `mizzou-cli` deployment to 0 replicas (already at 0)
2. Suspended `mizzou-crawler` cronjob temporarily
3. Freed up CPU for rolling update
4. Deployment succeeded
5. Resumed `mizzou-crawler` cronjob

**Cluster Resources:**
- **Nodes:** 2x e2-medium (2 CPU, 4GB RAM each)
- **Total Capacity:** 4 CPU, 8GB RAM
- **Processor Running:** Uses 469m CPU, 1810Mi RAM (actual usage during operation)
- **Processor Requests:** 100m CPU, 512Mi RAM (resource reservation)

### What Was Deployed

**New Features:**
1. **5 new database columns** in `extraction_telemetry_v2`:
   - `proxy_used` (BOOLEAN) - Whether proxy was enabled
   - `proxy_url` (TEXT) - Proxy URL (without credentials)
   - `proxy_authenticated` (BOOLEAN) - Whether credentials were provided
   - `proxy_status` (TEXT) - "success", "failed", "bypassed", or "disabled"
   - `proxy_error` (TEXT) - Error message if proxy failed

2. **9 REST API endpoints** at `/telemetry/proxy/*`:
   - `/telemetry/proxy/summary` - Overall proxy usage statistics
   - `/telemetry/proxy/trends` - Daily time-series data
   - `/telemetry/proxy/domains` - Per-domain proxy analysis
   - `/telemetry/proxy/errors` - Common error patterns
   - `/telemetry/proxy/authentication` - Auth status comparison
   - `/telemetry/proxy/comparison` - Proxy vs direct performance
   - `/telemetry/proxy/status-distribution` - Status code breakdown
   - `/telemetry/proxy/recent-failures` - Recent failure details
   - `/telemetry/proxy/bot-detection` - Bot detection pattern analysis

3. **Auto-migration:** Database schema changes applied automatically on first write

**Code Components:**
- `src/utils/comprehensive_telemetry.py` - Enhanced to capture proxy metadata
- `backend/app/telemetry/proxy.py` - New API endpoints module (515 lines)
- `backend/app/main.py` - Proxy router registered
- `docs/PROXY_TELEMETRY_QUERIES.md` - 17 SQL queries for analysis
- `PROXY_API_QUICKSTART.md` - Setup and testing guide

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Widespread Bot Blocking

### Current Extraction Status
- **Last 24 Hours:** 0 successful extractions
- **Pending Articles:** 124 articles stuck in queue
- **Extraction Runs:** 20+ attempts, all failed
- **Bot Detection Rate:** 100% (26/26 sampled attempts blocked with 403)

### Affected Domains (Last 24 Hours)

**Confirmed Bot Blocking (403 Forbidden):**
1. **fox2now.com** - 8 blocks (Nexstar Broadcasting Group)
2. **www.fourstateshomepage.com** - 7 blocks (Nexstar)
3. **fox4kc.com** - 6 blocks (Nexstar)
4. **www.ozarksfirst.com** - 5 blocks (Nexstar)
5. **mdcp.nwaonline.com** - Multiple blocks
6. **www.newstribune.com** - Multiple blocks
7. **www.fultonsun.com** - Failures
8. **www.californiademocrat.com** - Failures
9. **www.darnews.com** - Failures
10. **www.dddnews.com** - Failures
11. **www.edinasentinel.com** - Failures
12. **www.memphisdemocrat.com** - Failures
13. **www.kfvs12.com** - Failures
14. **www.maryvilleforum.com** - Failures

**CAPTCHA Challenges:**
- **www.theprospectnews.com** - CAPTCHA detected, 874s backoff triggered

### Timeline
- **Start of blocking:** ~October 9, 2025 22:33 UTC
- **Pattern:** All extraction runs after this time show 0 successful extractions
- **Behavior:** Domains being skipped due to rate limits/failures, queue unable to process

### Evidence from Logs
```
2025-10-10 01:40:04 - Batch 1 complete: 0 articles extracted
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  10 domains skipped due to rate limits
üì≠ No more articles available to extract
Total articles extracted: 0
```

**All 403 responses show same pattern:**
- HTML content starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Likely Cloudflare challenge page or similar bot detection
- **Proxy is being used** (logs show `‚úì Proxy response 403`)
- **Proxy authentication does not bypass blocking**

## üìã ACTION ITEMS - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY

### 1. ‚úÖ Verify Proxy Telemetry is Recording Failures

**Task:** Check if the new proxy telemetry system is capturing the bot blocking events.

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Option 1: Check via API (once backend is running)
curl 'http://localhost:8000/telemetry/proxy/summary?days=1'
curl 'http://localhost:8000/telemetry/proxy/bot-detection?days=1'
curl 'http://localhost:8000/telemetry/proxy/recent-failures?hours=24&limit=50'

# Option 2: Query database directly (if psql is available)
gcloud sql connect mizzou-db-prod --user=postgres --database=news_crawler
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN proxy_used THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_proxy,
  SUM(CASE WHEN proxy_status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as proxy_failed,
  SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 403 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as bot_blocked_403
FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

# Option 3: Check processor logs for telemetry writes
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=200 | grep -E "(proxy_used|proxy_status|Telemetry)"
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Telemetry should show `proxy_used = true`
- `proxy_status = "failed"` or `proxy_status = "success"` (but article extraction failed)
- `proxy_error` field should contain error details if proxy itself failed
- `http_status_code = 403` for bot-blocked requests

**If telemetry is NOT recording:**
- Check if auto-migration ran successfully
- Verify `comprehensive_telemetry.py` changes are in deployed image
- Check for errors in processor logs related to telemetry writes

### 2. üîç Investigate Bot Blocking Solutions

**Task:** Research and implement strategies to bypass anti-bot measures.

#### A. Analyze Bot Detection Patterns

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are all 403s coming from the same CDN/service? (likely Cloudflare)
2. What triggers the block? (User-Agent, IP, request patterns, missing headers?)
3. Does the block persist across different IPs? (test with proxy vs direct)
4. Are there specific times when blocking is less aggressive?

**Analysis queries:**
```sql
-- Get response HTML patterns for 403s
SELECT 
  host,
  COUNT(*) as blocks,
  LEFT(error_message, 100) as error_preview
FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
WHERE http_status_code = 403
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY host, LEFT(error_message, 100)
ORDER BY blocks DESC;

-- Check if proxy helps or hurts
SELECT 
  host,
  proxy_used,
  COUNT(*) as attempts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 403 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as blocked,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 403 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as block_rate
FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY host, proxy_used
ORDER BY host, proxy_used;
```

#### B. Potential Solutions to Test

**Short-term (Immediate Testing):**

1. **Rotate User-Agent strings**
   - Currently using newspaper3k default
   - Test with real browser User-Agents (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Rotate per request or per domain

2. **Add realistic browser headers**
   - `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9`
   - `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br`
   - `Sec-Fetch-*` headers
   - `Referer` header (set to domain homepage)

3. **Slow down request rate**
   - Current: 2.0-4.5s between requests
   - Try: 10-30s between requests for blocked domains
   - Implement domain-specific rate limits

4. **Test proxy effectiveness**
   - Compare direct vs proxy success rates
   - Try authenticated proxy vs unauthenticated
   - Consider residential proxy service (costs money)

5. **Selenium with full browser emulation**
   - Already have Selenium as fallback
   - But may need to use it as primary for blocked domains
   - Slower but more realistic browser fingerprint

**Medium-term (Implementation Required):**

1. **Implement stealth techniques**
   - Use `undetected-chromedriver` instead of standard Selenium
   - Randomize viewport sizes, timezone, canvas fingerprints
   - Avoid automation detection signals

2. **Request pattern randomization**
   - Don't always request articles in same order
   - Add random delays between batches
   - Vary time-of-day for crawling

3. **Domain-specific strategies**
   - Nexstar sites all blocked ‚Üí may need coordinated approach
   - Small local papers less likely to have strong anti-bot
   - Prioritize domains with lower blocking rates

**Long-term (Architectural):**

1. **Distributed crawling**
   - Multiple crawler pods with different IPs
   - GKE nodes in different regions
   - Cloud NAT with multiple external IPs

2. **RSS/API alternatives**
   - Many news sites offer RSS feeds
   - Some have APIs for aggregators
   - Legitimate partnership approach

3. **Respect rate limits more aggressively**
   - Longer CAPTCHA backoff (currently 15 min - 2 hours)
   - Domain cooldown periods (24 hours after repeated blocks)
   - Whitelist approach: only crawl known-good domains

#### C. Testing Plan

**Test Matrix:**
| Test | Method | Expected Result | Validation |
|------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Direct request (no proxy) | Disable proxy for sample | Check if still 403 | Compare telemetry |
| Realistic User-Agent | Chrome/Firefox UA | Lower block rate | Monitor success % |
| Full browser headers | All standard headers | Bypass detection | Check 200 responses |
| Longer delays | 30s between requests | Avoid rate limiting | Track over 1 hour |
| Selenium-first | Use Selenium for blocked domains | Higher success | Compare methods |

**Test Implementation:**
1. Create feature flag for testing (e.g., `TEST_BOT_BYPASS_MODE`)
2. Apply to single domain first (e.g., fox2now.com)
3. Monitor telemetry for 1-2 hours
4. Compare success rates: baseline vs test
5. Roll out if improvement > 50%

### 3. üìä Review Domains That Are Blocked

**Task:** Create comprehensive report of blocking patterns by domain.

**Analysis needed:**

1. **Blocking rate by domain (last 7 days)**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     host,
     COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
     SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 403 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as blocked_403,
     SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 503 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as blocked_503,
     SUM(CASE WHEN is_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
     ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code IN (403, 503) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as block_rate,
     ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN is_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as success_rate,
     MAX(created_at) as last_attempt
   FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
   WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   GROUP BY host
   ORDER BY block_rate DESC, total_attempts DESC
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

2. **Blocking timeline (when did it start?)**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE(created_at) as date,
     COUNT(*) as attempts,
     SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 403 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as blocked,
     ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN http_status_code = 403 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as block_rate
   FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
   WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days'
   GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
   ORDER BY date DESC;
   ```

3. **Domain ownership patterns**
   - Group domains by parent company (e.g., all Nexstar sites)
   - Check if blocking correlates with ownership
   - Identify which companies have strongest anti-bot measures

4. **Geographic patterns**
   - Are certain regions/states more blocked?
   - County-level analysis
   - Rural vs urban differences

**Output:** Create `BOT_BLOCKING_ANALYSIS.md` with:
- Full domain list with block rates
- Nexstar properties (confirmed blocking)
- Other media group correlations
- Domains still working (priority targets)
- Recommended domain prioritization strategy

## Future Deployment Best Practices

### Resource-Efficient Deployment Strategy

**For future deployments when cluster is at capacity:**

1. **Pre-deployment checklist:**
   ```bash
   # Check current resource usage
   kubectl top nodes
   kubectl top pods -n production
   
   # Identify temporary scale-down candidates
   kubectl get deployments -n production
   kubectl get cronjobs -n production
   ```

2. **Temporary scale-down procedure:**
   ```bash
   # Scale down non-critical services
   kubectl scale deployment mizzou-cli -n production --replicas=0
   
   # Suspend cronjobs
   kubectl patch cronjob mizzou-crawler -n production -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
   ```

3. **Deploy with freed resources:**
   ```bash
   # Trigger build
   gcloud builds triggers run build-processor-manual --branch=<branch>
   
   # Promote release
   gcloud deploy releases promote --release=<release> --to-target=production
   ```

4. **Post-deployment restore:**
   ```bash
   # Resume cronjobs
   kubectl patch cronjob mizzou-crawler -n production -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
   
   # Restore CLI if needed
   kubectl scale deployment mizzou-cli -n production --replicas=1
   ```

### Alternative Solutions (No Implementation Yet)

1. **Modify Deployment Strategy (Free):**
   - Set `strategy.type: Recreate` or `strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge: 0`
   - Terminates old pod before creating new one
   - Brief downtime but no extra resource consumption

2. **Lower Resource Requests Temporarily (Free):**
   - Reduce processor CPU request from 100m to 50m during deployment
   - Restore to 100m after rollout completes
   - Requires manifest change

3. **Node Auto-Scaling (Cost During Deployment Only):**
   - Enable GKE cluster autoscaling
   - Extra node spins up during deployment (2-3 min)
   - Scales back down after deployment (saves cost)
   - Cost: ~$0.05 for 5-10 minutes of e2-medium

4. **Scheduled Low-Activity Deployments (Free):**
   - Deploy during 3-5 AM when processor is idle
   - Temporarily reduce batch sizes before deployment
   - Lower resource usage allows smoother rollout

## Monitoring & Validation

### Health Checks

**Verify proxy telemetry system is working:**
```bash
# 1. Check processor logs for telemetry writes
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=100 | grep -i telemetry

# 2. Check database for new columns (once psql is installed)
\d+ extraction_telemetry_v2

# 3. Test API endpoints
curl 'http://localhost:8000/telemetry/proxy/summary?days=1'

# 4. Verify auto-migration ran
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=500 | grep -E "(migration|ALTER TABLE)"
```

### Ongoing Monitoring

**Daily checks:**
- Extraction success rate
- Bot blocking rate by domain
- Proxy effectiveness (success with proxy vs without)
- Resource usage trends

**Weekly reviews:**
- Domain blocking patterns
- New domains being blocked
- Effectiveness of anti-bot countermeasures
- Cost analysis (if using paid proxy services)
