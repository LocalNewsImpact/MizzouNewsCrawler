# Deployment Plan: PR #92 & PR #93 - Telemetry Testing Improvements

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: üü° CI VALIDATION IN PROGRESS  
**PRs**: #92 (Schema Drift Fixes) + #93 (Validation & ORM)
**CI Run**: Triggered by commit 5efe15c on feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment

## Overview

Both PRs add **testing and validation infrastructure** to prevent telemetry schema errors. These changes are **non-breaking** and primarily affect:
- CI/CD pipelines (new validation steps)
- Development workflow (pre-commit hooks)
- Testing infrastructure (new PostgreSQL tests)
- Optional ORM models (not yet used in production code)

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & CI/CD (Immediate - Zero Production Impact)

**What's Being Deployed:**
- ‚úÖ Schema validation script (`scripts/validate_telemetry_schemas.py`)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL CI job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Schema drift detection tests
- ‚úÖ Documentation

**Risk Level**: üü¢ **ZERO** - No production code changes

**Steps:**
1. Merge PRs to feature branch ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
2. Push to remote ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
3. Enable CI on feature branch ‚úÖ (COMPLETED - commit 5efe15c)
4. CI pipeline will automatically:
   - Run new PostgreSQL integration tests
   - Validate schema consistency
   - Run pre-commit hooks on future commits

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - First-Time Validation:**
The PostgreSQL integration tests added by PR #93 have NOT run yet because the original CI configuration only triggered on `main` branch. We just updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include the feature branch.

**Verification:**
```bash
# Monitor CI pipeline run (REQUIRED before merge to main)
# Navigate to: https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler/actions
# Expected: All jobs pass including new postgres-integration job

# Or check via CLI:
gh run list --branch feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment --limit 1

# Watch live:
gh run watch
```

**Critical:** Wait for CI to pass before merging to main. This validates:
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL integration tests work correctly
- ‚úÖ Schema validation passes
- ‚úÖ Alembic migrations apply successfully
- ‚úÖ All ORM tests pass against real PostgreSQL

**Rollback**: Not needed (no production changes)

---

### Phase 2: Schema Drift Fix (Low Risk - Production Database Compatible)

**What's Being Deployed:**
- Modified `src/utils/byline_telemetry.py` with 32-column CREATE TABLE
- Compatible with existing PostgreSQL schema (32 columns from Alembic)

**Risk Level**: üü° **LOW** - Fixes existing mismatch

**Current State:**
- Production DB: 32 columns (from Alembic migration)
- Code before fix: 28 columns in CREATE TABLE
- Code after fix: 32 columns in CREATE TABLE ‚úÖ
- **Result**: Code now matches production schema

**Deployment:**
This change is included in the current builds:
- Crawler: `fe9659f` (already deployed)
- Processor: `fe9659f` (already deployed)

**Risk Assessment:**
- CREATE TABLE statements only used in tests (SQLite)
- Production uses Alembic migrations (already has 32 columns)
- No INSERT statement changes in phase 2
- **Impact**: Zero production risk

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check production logs for byline telemetry errors
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor | grep "byline_cleaning_telemetry"
```

**Expected Result**: No schema mismatch errors (already fixed in fe9659f)

**Rollback**: Not needed (already deployed and working)

---

### Phase 3: ORM Models (Optional - Not Yet Active)

**What's Available:**
- ORM models in `src/models/telemetry_orm.py`
- ORM unit tests in `tests/models/test_telemetry_orm.py`
- Migration guide in `docs/TELEMETRY_ORM_MIGRATION.md`

**Risk Level**: üü¢ **ZERO** - Not used in production yet

**Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Models created and tested
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Not yet integrated into production code paths
- üìã Available for future gradual adoption

**Next Steps (Future Work):**
1. Add feature flag: `USE_TELEMETRY_ORM=false`
2. Implement parallel ORM path alongside raw SQL
3. Test in staging with feature flag enabled
4. Monitor performance metrics
5. Gradual rollout to production

**Timeline**: TBD (requires separate implementation work)

gcloud builds list --filter="tags=feature-gcp-kubernetes-deployment" --limit=5
```

**Step 4: Deploy to Staging** (Optional verification)
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment first
kubectl set image deployment/mizzou-processor \
  processor=gcr.io/mizzou-news-api/processor:827e3d1 \
  -n staging

# Monitor staging logs
kubectl logs -n staging -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=100 -f
```

**Step 5: Deploy to Production**
```bash
# Already deployed as part of fe9659f
# Verify current version
kubectl get deployment mizzou-processor -n production -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

**Check 1: CI Pipeline Health**
```bash
# View recent CI runs
# Navigate to: https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler/actions
# Verify: PostgreSQL job passes, schema validation passes
```

**Check 2: Pre-commit Hooks Active**
```bash
# Make a test commit to trigger hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
# Expected: Schema validation hook runs successfully
```

**Check 3: Production Stability**
```bash
# Check for telemetry errors
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --since=1h | grep -i "error\|exception" | grep -i "telemetry"

# Expected: No schema-related errors
```

**Check 4: Schema Validation**
```bash
# Run validation script
python scripts/validate_telemetry_schemas.py

# Expected output:
# ‚úì byline_telemetry.py matches migration (32 columns)
# ‚úì All INSERT statements valid
```

## Risk Assessment

| Component | Risk Level | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| CI/CD changes | üü¢ Zero | Dev workflow only | Automated tests validate |
| Pre-commit hooks | üü¢ Zero | Dev workflow only | Can be skipped if needed |
| Schema drift fix | üü° Low | Already deployed (fe9659f) | Monitoring in place |
| ORM models | üü¢ Zero | Not used yet | Future gradual rollout |

**Overall Risk**: üü¢ **VERY LOW**

## Rollback Plan

### If CI Pipeline Issues Occur
```bash
# Disable problematic CI job temporarily
# Edit .github/workflows/ci.yml on feature branch
# Remove postgres-integration job
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "temp: Disable PostgreSQL CI job for troubleshooting"
git push origin feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment
```

### If Pre-commit Hooks Block Development
```bash
# Skip pre-commit hooks if blocking
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"

# Or disable hook temporarily
pre-commit uninstall
```

### If Production Issues (Unlikely)
```bash
# Revert to previous image
kubectl set image deployment/mizzou-processor \
  processor=gcr.io/mizzou-news-api/processor:v1.3.0 \
  -n production

# Monitor recovery
kubectl rollout status deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

**CI/CD Health:**
- GitHub Actions success rate
- Schema validation pass rate
- PostgreSQL test pass rate

**Production Stability:**
- Telemetry error rate (should remain at 0)
- Byline cleaning success rate
- Database constraint violations

**Developer Experience:**
- Pre-commit hook execution time
- Schema validation speed
- Test suite execution time

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check recent CI runs
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit=10

# Check production telemetry errors
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --since=24h | \
  grep -i "byline_cleaning_telemetry" | \
  grep -i "error\|exception" | wc -l

# Expected: 0 errors

# Check processor health
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
```

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders to Notify

**Team:**
- Development team: New pre-commit hooks active
- QA team: PostgreSQL integration tests in CI
- DevOps: CI/CD pipeline changes

**Notifications:**

**Development Team:**
> New pre-commit hooks active! Schema validation runs automatically on telemetry file changes. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to test. Can skip with `--no-verify` if needed.

**DevOps Team:**
> PR #92 & #93 merged. CI pipeline now includes PostgreSQL integration tests and schema validation. No production deployment needed - changes are testing infrastructure only.

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor CI pipeline** for 1 week
   - Verify PostgreSQL tests stable
   - Check schema validation catching issues

2. **Gather developer feedback** on pre-commit hooks
   - Execution time acceptable?
   - Any false positives?

3. **Plan ORM adoption** (future work)
   - Identify first code path to migrate

## Summary

üü° **Deployment Status: VALIDATION IN PROGRESS**

These PRs add testing infrastructure with **zero production risk**. The schema drift fix was deployed with fe9659f. We've now enabled CI on the feature branch to validate all changes before merging to main.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ All changes non-breaking
- ‚úÖ Schema fix already deployed (fe9659f)
- ‚úÖ CI enabled on feature branch (5efe15c)
- üü° CI validation in progress - **WAITING FOR RESULTS**
- üìã ORM adoption is future work

**Next Action Required:**
Monitor GitHub Actions and wait for CI to pass. Once green, the feature branch can be safely merged to main.

```bash
# Check CI status:
gh run list --branch feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment --limit 1

# Watch live:
gh run watch
```

**What We're Validating:**
1. PostgreSQL integration tests run successfully
2. Schema validation passes
3. Alembic migrations work correctly
4. ORM models work against real PostgreSQL
5. All existing tests still pass

This is the **first time** these new tests will run, as they weren't previously triggered on the feature branch.
