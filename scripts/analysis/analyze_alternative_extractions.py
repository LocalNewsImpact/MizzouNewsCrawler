Alternative Extraction Analysis Tool

Analyzes the telemetry database to find cases where later extraction methods
found alternative values for fields that were already populated by earlier methods.
This helps identify:
1. Which methods provide different/better versions of the same field
2. Whether later methods consistently find different content
3. Potential improvements to extraction quality
