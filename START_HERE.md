**Date**: October 15, 2025, 3:45 PM CST  
**Action Required**: Deploy PR #78 Phase 1  
**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes + 24h monitoring

---

---

## üöÄ Execute Now (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Record Baseline (5 minutes)

Open a SQL client and run these queries. **Copy the results** to a text file:

```sql
-- Baseline: Article counts
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM articles
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Baseline: Candidate link counts  
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM candidate_links
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Baseline: Extraction rate (last 24 hours)
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as articles
FROM articles
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC
LIMIT 24;
```

**Save results to**: `baseline_metrics_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt`

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script (10-15 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/kiesowd/VSCode/NewsCrawler/MizzouNewsCrawler-Scripts

# Execute automated deployment
./scripts/deploy_phase1.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Merge PR #78 to feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment
2. ‚úÖ Run 32 tests
3. ‚úÖ Trigger Cloud Build
4. ‚úÖ Deploy new processor image
5. ‚úÖ Validate feature flags

**Follow the prompts** - the script will ask for confirmation at key steps.

### Step 3: Validate Deployment (5 minutes)

```bash
# Check processor is running
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

# Expected output:
# NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# mizzou-processor-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx  1/1     Running   0          2m

# Verify feature flags in logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=200 | grep -A 10 "Enabled pipeline steps"

# Expected output:
# Enabled pipeline steps:
#   - Discovery: ‚ùå
#   - Verification: ‚ùå
#   - Extraction: ‚ùå
#   - Cleaning: ‚úÖ
#   - ML Analysis: ‚úÖ
#   - Entity Extraction: ‚úÖ
```

‚úÖ **Deployment complete!**

---

## üìä Monitor for 24 Hours

### Continuous Monitoring (keep this running)

```bash
# Stream processor logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --follow
```

**What to look for**:
- ‚úÖ No errors (occasional network issues are OK)
- ‚úÖ "Work queue status" messages every minute
- ‚úÖ `cleaning_pending`, `analysis_pending`, `entity_extraction_pending` decreasing
- ‚úÖ `verification_pending` and `extraction_pending` = 0

### Periodic Checks (every 4-6 hours)

```bash
# Pod health
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

# Should show: 1/1 Running, 0 restarts

# Error count (should be <10 per 2 hours)
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --since=2h | grep -i "error" | wc -l

# Resource usage (should be stable)
kubectl top pod -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
```

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Tests (Tomorrow, Oct 16)

Run these tests **after 24 hours** of monitoring:

### Test 1: Processor Health ‚úÖ

```bash
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
```
**Pass criteria**: 1/1 Running, 0 restarts

### Test 2: Feature Flags ‚úÖ

```bash
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=200 | grep -A 10 "Enabled pipeline steps"
```
**Pass criteria**: Discovery ‚ùå, Verification ‚ùå, Extraction ‚ùå, Cleaning ‚úÖ, ML ‚úÖ, Entities ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Processing Continues ‚úÖ

```sql
-- Run at 24h mark and compare to baseline
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'extracted' THEN 1 END) as cleaning_pending,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'cleaned' AND primary_label IS NULL THEN 1 END) as analysis_pending
FROM articles;
```
**Pass criteria**: Both numbers decreased since baseline

### Test 4: No New Extractions ‚úÖ

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as new_extractions
FROM articles
WHERE status = 'extracted' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```
**Pass criteria**: Count = 0 (this is expected!)

### Test 5: System Stability ‚úÖ

```bash
# Error count
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --since=24h | grep -i "error" | wc -l

# Resource usage
kubectl top pod -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
```
**Pass criteria**: Errors <50 in 24h, CPU/memory within 50% of baseline

---

## üéØ Decision Point (Tomorrow Evening)

After running all 5 validation tests:

### If All Tests Pass ‚Üí GO to Phase 2 ‚úÖ

**Action**: Proceed to Phase 2 (Mizzou Extraction Testing)

**Next steps**:
1. Review Phase 2 plan in `PR78_ROLLOUT_PLAN.md` (starting page ~15)
2. Deploy Mizzou extraction job (Week 1, Days 3-7)
3. Monitor parallel operation

### If Any Test Fails ‚Üí NO-GO ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Action**: Investigate and fix issue

**Possible actions**:
- Review logs for error patterns
- Check database connections
- Verify resource usage
- Consider rollback if critical

---

## üîÑ Emergency Rollback

**If deployment fails or processor crashes**:

```bash
# Immediate rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/mizzou-processor -n production
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=50
```

**Time to recover**: <2 minutes  
**Data loss**: None
