# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please do not
open a public issue. Instead, contact the maintainers privately so we
can investigate and address the issue responsibly.

Contact: `security@localnewsimpact.org`

We will respond to reports within 3 business days and aim to resolve
critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. For non-critical issues
we'll provide a timeline for remediation.

## Supported Versions

We provide security fixes for the latest release and the prior minor
release. If you need support for older releases, please contact the
maintainers to discuss.
