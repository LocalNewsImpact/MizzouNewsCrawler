# Telemetry Migration to Cloud SQL - Completion Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the telemetry and site management endpoint migration from SQLite to Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), addressing Issues #25 and #36.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Database Schema & Models

Created SQLAlchemy ORM models for telemetry data:

**File: `src/models/telemetry.py`**
- `ExtractionTelemetryV2` - Comprehensive extraction telemetry with:
  - Operation and article tracking
  - Timing metrics (start_time, end_time, total_duration_ms)
  - HTTP metrics (status_code, error_type, response_size, response_time)
  - Method tracking (attempted methods, successful method, timings)
  - Field extraction tracking (JSON-encoded field-level data)
  - Success/failure results
  
- `HttpErrorSummary` - HTTP error aggregation with:
  - Host and status code tracking
  - Error counts and timestamps (first_seen, last_seen)
  - Error type classification

**File: `src/models/__init__.py`**
- Updated `Source` model with site management fields:
  - `status` - 'active' or 'paused'
  - `paused_at` - Timestamp when site was paused
  - `paused_reason` - Reason for pausing (free text)

### 2. Database Migration

**File: `alembic/versions/a1b2c3d4e5f6_add_extraction_telemetry_tables.py`**

Created Alembic migration that:
- Creates `extraction_telemetry_v2` table with all indexes
- Creates `http_error_summary` table with indexes
- Adds site management columns to existing `sources` table
- Includes proper downgrade path

**Migration can be applied with:**
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. API Endpoint Migration

Migrated all 10 telemetry and site management endpoints in `backend/app/main.py`:

#### Telemetry Endpoints (7)

1. **`GET /api/telemetry/http-errors`** (line ~1585)
   - Query HTTP error statistics by host, status code, and time period
   - Aggregates error counts from `http_error_summary` table
   - Filters: days, host, status_code

2. **`GET /api/telemetry/method-performance`** (line ~1650)
   - Extraction method performance analysis
   - Groups by method and host
   - Calculates success rates, avg/min/max duration
   - Filters: days, method, host

3. **`GET /api/telemetry/publisher-stats`** (line ~1725)
   - Publisher-level performance statistics
   - Success rates, duration, method count
   - Health status calculation (poor/fair/good)
   - Filters: days, host, min_attempts

4. **`GET /api/telemetry/field-extraction`** (line ~1774)
   - Field-level extraction success rates
   - Parses JSON field_extraction data
   - Calculates per-field success rates (title, author, content, date)
   - Filters: days, field, method, host

5. **`GET /api/telemetry/poor-performers`** (line ~1810)
   - Identifies sites with low success rates
   - Provides recommendations (pause/monitor)
   - Filters: days, min_attempts, max_success_rate

6. **`GET /api/telemetry/summary`** (line ~1870)
   - Overall dashboard summary
   - Total extractions, success rate, unique hosts
   - Method breakdown with success rates
   - Top 10 HTTP errors
   - Filters: days

7. **`GET /api/telemetry/queue`** (line ~1075)
   - Queue status monitoring (already Cloud SQL compatible)
   - Returns snapshot queue size and worker status

#### Site Management Endpoints (3)

8. **`POST /api/site-management/pause`** (line ~1965)
   - Pause a site from crawling
   - Creates or updates Source record with paused status
   - Records pause reason and timestamp

9. **`POST /api/site-management/resume`** (line ~1997)
   - Resume a previously paused site
   - Updates Source record to active status
   - Clears pause reason and timestamp

10. **`GET /api/site-management/paused`** (line ~2017)
    - List all currently paused sites
    - Returns host, paused_at, reason

11. **`GET /api/site-management/status/{host}`** (line ~2034)
    - Get status of a specific site
    - Returns status, paused_at, paused_reason

### 4. Code Cleanup

**Removed:**
- `MAIN_DB_PATH` constant (no longer needed)
- `ComprehensiveExtractionTelemetry` import (replaced with direct ORM queries)
- All SQLite connection code for telemetry (`sqlite3.connect(MAIN_DB_PATH)`)

**Retained:**
- `DB_PATH` for reviews database (separate concern, not part of this migration)
- SQLite usage for reviews API endpoints (future migration)

### 5. Implementation Details

**Database Manager Usage:**
```python
with db_manager.get_session() as session:
    # All queries use SQLAlchemy ORM
    query = session.query(ExtractionTelemetryV2)
    # ...
```

**Key Patterns:**
- Context managers for automatic session cleanup
- SQLAlchemy func.* for aggregations (count, sum, avg, etc.)
- func.coalesce() for handling NULL values in method names
- case() expressions for conditional aggregation
- Proper datetime handling with isoformat() for JSON responses

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All API response formats maintained exactly
- Date/time fields returned as ISO 8601 strings
- No breaking changes to API contracts

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Environment Setup

Set environment variables for Cloud SQL:
```bash
export USE_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTOR=true
export CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=project:region:instance
export DB_USER=username
export DB_PASSWORD=password
export DB_NAME=database
```

Or use direct connection:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

### 2. Run Migrations

Apply Alembic migrations to create tables:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. Endpoint Testing

Test each endpoint with sample requests:

```bash
# Telemetry endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telemetry/http-errors?days=7
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telemetry/method-performance?days=7
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telemetry/publisher-stats?min_attempts=5
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telemetry/field-extraction?days=7
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telemetry/poor-performers?max_success_rate=50
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telemetry/summary?days=7

# Site management endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/site-management/pause \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"host": "example.com", "reason": "Testing"}'

curl http://localhost:8000/api/site-management/paused
curl http://localhost:8000/api/site-management/status/example.com

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/site-management/resume \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"host": "example.com"}'
```

### 4. Data Validation

After running the crawler with telemetry enabled:

```sql
-- Check telemetry data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM extraction_telemetry_v2;
SELECT host, COUNT(*) FROM extraction_telemetry_v2 GROUP BY host LIMIT 10;

-- Check error summary
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM http_error_summary;
SELECT host, status_code, count FROM http_error_summary ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check paused sites
SELECT host, status, paused_at, paused_reason FROM sources WHERE status = 'paused';
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run Alembic migrations on Cloud SQL: `alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] Deploy updated API backend (v1.3.2+)
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Test each telemetry endpoint
- [ ] Test site management endpoints
- [ ] Verify data is persisting across pod restarts
- [ ] Check API logs for any errors
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Known Limitations

1. **Historical Data Migration:** Existing SQLite telemetry data is NOT automatically migrated. The new endpoints will only show data collected after deployment.

2. **ComprehensiveExtractionTelemetry Class:** The class in `src/utils/comprehensive_telemetry.py` still uses SQLite. If other parts of the codebase use this class, they will continue to write to SQLite. Consider:
   - Updating the class to use DatabaseManager
   - Or deprecating it in favor of direct ORM usage

3. **Field Extraction JSON:** The field_extraction endpoint parses JSON stored in TEXT columns. For high-volume queries, consider:
   - Using PostgreSQL JSONB columns for better performance
   - Pre-computing common aggregations
   - Adding indexes on commonly queried fields

4. **Time Zone Handling:** All timestamps use UTC (`datetime.utcnow()`). Ensure consistency across the application.

## Success Criteria - ACHIEVED âœ…

- [x] All 10 endpoints migrated to Cloud SQL
- [x] All endpoints use `DatabaseManager` + SQLAlchemy ORM
- [x] Zero SQLite connections for telemetry in `backend/app/main.py`
- [x] API response formats unchanged (backward compatible)
- [x] Alembic migration created and ready to deploy
- [x] Code is syntactically correct and models import successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run migration and test endpoints
   - Verify data persistence

2. **Short-term:**
   - Update `ComprehensiveExtractionTelemetry` class to use Cloud SQL
   - Consider migrating reviews endpoints (currently still on SQLite)
   - Add monitoring/alerting for telemetry data quality

3. **Long-term:**
   - Consider performance optimizations (JSONB, materialized views)
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Build dashboard visualizations using the telemetry data
