# Issue #46 Test Infrastructure Fixes - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for Issue #46, which addressed test failures after the Cloud SQL migration. The work focused on updating test infrastructure to work with the new database architecture.

## Issues Identified from Issue #46

The original issue identified 103 test failures (10.7% failure rate) across several categories:

1. **33 errors**: Missing `google-cloud-sql-python-connector` in test environment
2. **11 failures**: Alembic migration conflicts with duplicate table creation
3. **12 failures**: Integration tests can't properly initialize `DatabaseManager`
4. **5 failures**: Telemetry tests expect outdated CSV-based schema
5. **12 failures**: Tests reference removed `MAIN_DB_PATH` constant

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Alembic Migration Conflicts ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Problem**: The `byline_cleaning_telemetry` table was created in two migrations:
- `e3114395bcc4_add_api_backend_and_telemetry_tables.py` (first, complete version)
- `a9957c3054a4_add_remaining_telemetry_tables.py` (second, duplicate)

This caused "table already exists" errors when running migrations sequentially.

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate table creation from migration `a9957c3054a4`
- Removed duplicate `byline_transformation_steps` table creation
- Kept only the new index on `created_at` column (which wasn't in the first migration)
- Updated downgrade function accordingly

**Files Modified**:
- `alembic/versions/a9957c3054a4_add_remaining_telemetry_tables.py`

**Result**: Migrations now run successfully without "table already exists" errors.

### 2. MAIN_DB_PATH References ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Problem**: After migrating from CSV to Cloud SQL, the backend replaced the `MAIN_DB_PATH` constant with a `DatabaseManager` instance (`db_manager`). However, tests were still trying to mock `MAIN_DB_PATH`, causing AttributeError.

**Solution**:
- Updated all tests to mock `db_manager.engine` instead of `MAIN_DB_PATH`
- Modified fixtures to create test SQLite engines and inject them via monkeypatch
- Used proper SQLAlchemy engine mocking pattern (consistent with `tests/backend/conftest.py`)

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/test_telemetry_api.py`
  - `api_client` fixture in `TestSiteManagementAPI`
  - `test_telemetry_endpoints_with_invalid_database`
  - `test_site_management_with_invalid_data`
  - `test_telemetry_to_site_management_workflow`

**Example Fix**:
```python
# Before (broken):
with patch("backend.app.main.MAIN_DB_PATH", temp_db):
    client = TestClient(app)

# After (working):
from backend.app.main import app, db_manager
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

db_url = f"sqlite:///{temp_db}"
test_engine = create_engine(db_url, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
monkeypatch.setattr(db_manager, "engine", test_engine)
client = TestClient(app)
```

**Result**: All 16 tests in `test_telemetry_api.py` now pass (100%).

### 3. TelemetryStore URL Parsing ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Tests were passing raw file paths to `TelemetryStore`, but SQLAlchemy expects proper database URLs (e.g., `sqlite:///path`), not raw paths.

**Solution**:
- Updated `tracker_factory` fixture to convert paths to proper SQLite URLs
- Changed from `str(db_path)` to `f"sqlite:///{db_path}"`

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/utils/test_operation_tracker.py`

**Example Fix**:
```python
# Before (broken):
store = TelemetryStore(database=str(db_path), async_writes=False)

# After (working):
db_url = f"sqlite:///{db_path}"
store = TelemetryStore(database=db_url, async_writes=False)
```

**Result**: 2 out of 4 tests in `test_operation_tracker.py` now pass (50%). The remaining 2 tests have a deeper architectural issue with cursor interface compatibility between old and new telemetry code.

### 4. Cloud SQL Connector Configuration ‚úÖ ALREADY HANDLED

**Problem**: Tests were failing when `DatabaseManager` tried to use Cloud SQL connector in test environment.

**Finding**: The infrastructure was already in place:
- `USE_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTOR` environment variable already supported
- `DatabaseManager._should_use_cloud_sql_connector()` already checks this variable
- Most test fixtures already set `USE_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTOR=false`

**Result**: No changes needed. Alembic tests already properly configure this.

## Test Results Summary

### Before Fixes
- **Total**: 966 tests
- **Passed**: 863 (89.3%)
- **Failed**: 61 (6.3%)
- **Errors**: 33 (3.4%)
- **Skipped**: 9 (0.9%)

### After Fixes (for affected test suites)
- **Alembic migrations**: 11 tests - 8 pass, 3 fail (assertion issues, not functional failures)
- **Backend API** (`tests/backend/`): 41/41 tests passing (100%) ‚úÖ
- **Telemetry API** (`tests/test_telemetry_api.py`): 16/16 tests passing (100%) ‚úÖ
- **E2E Discovery** (`tests/e2e/test_discovery_pipeline.py`): 7 tests - 1 pass, 6 need Cloud SQL connector
- **Operation Tracker** (`tests/utils/test_operation_tracker.py`): 2/4 tests passing (50%)

### Remaining Known Issues (Lower Priority)

1. **E2E Tests Need Cloud SQL Connector** (~10 tests)
   - These tests are correctly trying to use Cloud SQL but credentials aren't available
   - Expected behavior in test environment
   - Tests will pass when Cloud SQL credentials are available
   - **Fix**: Set up Cloud SQL test instance or mock connector for CI/CD

2. **Telemetry API Data Volume Mismatches** (~5 tests)
   - Tests expect specific numbers of records (e.g., "assert 5 extractions")
   - Test databases have different data than expected
   - Not a code issue, just test data setup
   - **Fix**: Update test expectations or improve test data fixtures

3. **Operation Tracker Cursor Compatibility** (2 tests)
   - Old telemetry code expects raw SQLite cursor with `fetchone()`
   - New TelemetryStore provides wrapped connection with different interface
   - Architectural incompatibility, not a simple fix
   - **Fix**: Refactor operation tracker to use TelemetryStore's interface consistently

4. **Alembic Test Assertions** (3 tests)
   - Tests check stdout for "Running upgrade" but Alembic outputs to stderr
   - Migrations themselves work correctly (returncode=0)
   - Minor test implementation issue
   - **Fix**: Update test assertions to check stderr instead of stdout
