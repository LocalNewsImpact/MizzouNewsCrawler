"""Reset candidate_links that were marked as extracted but failed to write to articles table.

This script identifies candidate_links that have status 'extracted', 'labeled', 'wire', or 'obituary'
but have no corresponding entry in the articles table (due to the Cloud SQL Connector async/await bug
that caused silent commit failures from Oct 22-24, 2025).

It resets their status back to 'verified' so they can be re-extracted.
