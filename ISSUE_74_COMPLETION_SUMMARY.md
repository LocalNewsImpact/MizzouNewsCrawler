# Issue #74 Completion Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented smart single-domain detection for job-per-dataset extraction architecture, addressing the core issue where the Lehigh Valley News extraction job was struggling with rate limits due to being unable to rotate through multiple domains.

## Problem Statement (Original)

> "the lehigh job only has one domain - it is not rotating through domains - it needs to be smart enough to know that."

The Lehigh extraction job processes articles from only `lehighvalleynews.com`, but the system was treating it the same as multi-domain datasets. This led to:
- Reactive rate limiting (only after detecting issues per-batch)
- Unnecessary attempts at domain rotation
- Unclear operator feedback
- Risk of bot detection and IP blocks

## Solution Implemented

### Core Enhancement: Proactive Domain Analysis

Added upfront domain analysis that happens **before extraction begins**, rather than learning reactively during processing.

**New Function: `_analyze_dataset_domains()`**
```python
def _analyze_dataset_domains(args, session):
    """Analyze how many unique domains exist in the dataset's candidate links."""
    # Samples up to 1000 URLs
    # Returns: {unique_domains, is_single_domain, sample_domains}
```

### Smart Rate Limiting Logic

**Before** (Reactive):
- Detect single-domain situation after processing each batch
- Apply long pause only after exhausting domain rotation attempts

**After** (Proactive):
```python
needs_long_pause = (
    is_single_domain_dataset or           # NEW: Detected upfront
    same_domain_consecutive >= 3 or       # Fallback
    unique_domains <= 1                   # Fallback
)
```

### Enhanced User Feedback

**Console Output**:
```
🚀 Starting content extraction...
   Mode: Process ALL available articles
   Articles per batch: 3
   📊 Dataset analysis: 1 unique domain(s)
   ⚠️  Single-domain dataset detected: lehighvalleynews.com
   🐌 Rate limiting will be conservative to avoid bot detection

📄 Processing batch 1 (3 articles)...
   ⏸️  Single-domain dataset - waiting 420s...
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests ✅

All new functionality covered by tests:

```bash
test_analyze_dataset_domains_single_domain      PASS
test_analyze_dataset_domains_multiple_domains   PASS  
test_analyze_dataset_domains_no_urls            PASS
```

### Manual Verification ✅

Logic tested with simulated Lehigh dataset:
```
Test Case 1: Lehigh (Single Domain)
  Unique domains: 1
  Is single domain: True
  Sample domains: ['lehighvalleynews.com']
  
✓ PASS: Long pause will be applied for Lehigh job
  Reason: Single-domain dataset detected upfront
```

### Syntax Validation ✅

```bash
python -m py_compile src/cli/commands/extraction.py
python -m py_compile tests/cli/commands/test_extraction.py
✓ All Python files have valid syntax
```

## Benefits

- ✅ Warnings for misconfiguration (e.g., BATCH_SLEEP_SECONDS too low)
- ✅ Easier troubleshooting with explicit reasoning

### 4. Cost Efficiency
- ✅ Fewer 429 rate limit errors
- ✅ Less wasted compute time on blocked requests
- ✅ Reduced need for manual intervention
- ✅ More predictable job completion times

### 5. Operator-Friendly
- ✅ Quick reference guide for common scenarios

- ✅ Copy-paste configurations for different use cases
- ✅ Monitoring commands ready to use

## Lehigh Job Impact

### Current Configuration (Already Optimal)

The existing `k8s/lehigh-extraction-job.yaml` already has good configuration:

```yaml
- name: BATCH_SLEEP_SECONDS
  value: "420.0"  # 7 minutes ✅
- name: BATCH_SLEEP_JITTER
  value: "0.45"   # 45% jitter ✅
- name: INTER_REQUEST_MIN
  value: "90.0"   # 90 seconds ✅
- name: INTER_REQUEST_MAX
  value: "180.0"  # 3 minutes ✅
```

### What Changes With This Implementation

**No YAML changes needed!** The system now:

1. **Detects** Lehigh is single-domain on startup
2. **Confirms** the configuration is appropriate
3. **Applies** conservative rate limiting automatically
4. **Shows** clear feedback about what it's doing

### Expected Output

When the updated code runs on Lehigh:

```
🚀 Starting content extraction...
   Batches: 150
   Articles per batch: 3
   📊 Dataset analysis: 1 unique domain(s)
   ⚠️  Single-domain dataset detected: lehighvalleynews.com
   🐌 Rate limiting will be conservative to avoid bot detection

📄 Processing batch 1 (3 articles)...
✓ Batch 1 complete: 3 articles extracted (447 remaining)
   ⏸️  Single-domain dataset - waiting 420s...

📄 Processing batch 2 (3 articles)...
...
```

```

### For Multi-Domain Datasets

**Standard Configuration**:
```yaml
env:
  - name: BATCH_SLEEP_SECONDS
    value: "30"   # Can be faster with rotation
  - name: INTER_REQUEST_MIN
    value: "10"   # Faster between requests
  - name: INTER_REQUEST_MAX
    value: "30"
```

## Monitoring

### Watch Domain Detection

```bash
# See domain analysis on job start
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Penn-State-Lehigh --follow | grep "Dataset analysis"

# Watch for single-domain detection
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Penn-State-Lehigh --follow | grep "Single-domain"
```

### Monitor Rate Limiting

```bash
# Watch batch pauses
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Penn-State-Lehigh --follow | grep "⏸️"

# Check for rate limit errors
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Penn-State-Lehigh --follow | grep "429\|rate limit"
```
