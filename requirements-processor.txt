# Processor-specific requirements
# These packages are only needed for the background processor service
# Note: Heavy ML dependencies (torch, transformers, etc.) are in requirements-ml.txt
# and installed in the ml-base image to speed up processor builds

# Processor-specific utilities only
# (Currently all heavy dependencies are in ml-base, so this file is minimal)
# Add lightweight processor-specific packages here as needed

# Browser automation used for last-resort extraction in processor
