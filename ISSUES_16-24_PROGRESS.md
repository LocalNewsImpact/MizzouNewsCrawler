### Issue #19: Phase 5 - Data Migration

**Status**: MOSTLY COMPLETE

✅ **Complete**:
- SQLite → PostgreSQL migration: DONE
- Database exclusively using Cloud SQL Postgres
- Alembic migrations operational (head: fe5057825d26)
- Last SQLite fallback bug fixed today

❌ **Missing**:
- BigQuery export pipeline (tables exist, but no scheduled export job)
- Cloud Storage for raw HTML (not confirmed)

**Next Steps**: Create scheduled CronJob to export article data to BigQuery.

---

### Issue #20: Phase 6 - Frontend Development

**Status**: MINIMAL

✅ **Complete**:
- React app created (web/frontend/)
- Vite + React 18 + Material-UI
- Basic structure in place
- Build pipeline working

❌ **Missing**:
- Full admin portal
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Telemetry dashboard components

**Assessment**: Basic frontend exists but lacks most planned features.

---

### Issue #21: Phase 7 - Security & Compliance

**Status**: BASIC SECURITY ONLY

✅ **Complete**:
- Kubernetes secrets in use
- Private networking (GKE private IPs, Cloud SQL proxy)
- Workload Identity for service accounts

❌ **Missing**:
- OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, GitHub providers)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- JWT token management
- SSL/TLS with cert-manager
- Audit logging

**Assessment**: Infrastructure security is solid, but application-level auth/authz not implemented.

---

### Issue #22: Phase 8 - Observability & Monitoring

**Status**: MINIMAL

✅ **Complete**:
- Database telemetry system (PostgreSQL-backed)
- CLI monitoring: `pipeline-status` command
- Structured logging in application code
- Basic health check endpoints

❌ **Missing**:
- ❌ Cloud Monitoring dashboards (critical gap!)
- ❌ Prometheus/Grafana stack
- ❌ Alert policies (error rates, latency, budget)
- ❌ Custom metrics instrumentation
- ❌ Dashboard visualizations

**Assessment**: This is the **biggest gap** in the roadmap. We have basic telemetry but no production-grade observability.

---

### Issue #23: Phase 9 - Testing & Validation

**Status**: MINIMAL

✅ **Complete**:
- Some unit tests exist in tests/ directory
- Integration tests for database migrations

❌ **Missing**:
- Load testing suite (Locust)
- Staging environment
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- End-to-end pipeline tests
- Performance benchmarks

**Assessment**: Testing infrastructure is underdeveloped.

---

### Issue #24: Phase 10 - Production Launch

## Priority Next Steps

### High Priority (Critical Gaps)

1. **Issue #22: Cloud Monitoring Dashboards** 🔥
   - Create system health dashboard (CPU, memory, pods)
   - Create pipeline metrics dashboard (articles/hour, success rate)
   - Create business metrics dashboard (articles by county)
   - **Why critical**: Currently flying blind on system health

2. **Issue #22: Alert Policies** 🔥
   - Critical: API error rate > 5%, pod restarts, DB failure
   - Warning: High latency, memory usage > 80%
   - Budget: Monthly spend > $180 (90% of $200 target)
   - **Why critical**: No alerts means we don't know when things break

3. **Issue #19: BigQuery Export Pipeline**
   - Create scheduled CronJob to export article data
   - Enable analytics and reporting capabilities
   - **Why important**: BigQuery tables are empty despite existing

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

4. **Issue #21: OAuth & RBAC**
   - Implement authentication in frontend
   - Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Implement role-based permissions
   - **Why useful**: Currently no user access control

5. **Issue #23: Staging Environment**
   - Create separate namespace
   - Test deployments before production
   - **Why useful**: Reduce production deployment risk

6. **Issue #24: Production Runbook**
   - Document common operations
   - Create troubleshooting playbook
   - Establish cost monitoring
   - **Why useful**: Easier operations and handoff

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

7. **Issue #20: Full Frontend Features**
   - Complete admin portal
   - Add telemetry dashboard UI
   - Implement user management
   - **Why lower**: Backend is functional without UI

8. **Issue #23: Comprehensive Testing**
   - Load testing suite
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Performance benchmarks
   - **Why lower**: Current testing is adequate for now

## Decision Points

### What We Chose vs Roadmap

| Component | Roadmap Plan | Actual Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Orchestration | Helm charts | Raw Kubernetes YAML | Single environment, simpler debugging |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Cloud Build + GitHub Actions | Cloud Build for images, GitHub Actions for automation |
| Frontend | Full admin portal | Minimal React app | Focus on backend stability first |
| Observability | Prometheus + Grafana | Database telemetry only | Simpler for MVP, but needs expansion |
| Testing | Comprehensive suite | Basic unit tests | Time constraints, production stability prioritized |

### Technical Debt Acknowledged

1. **No production monitoring dashboards**: This is the biggest operational risk
2. **No alert policies**: We don't get notified of issues
3. **Minimal frontend**: Limits user interaction
4. **No OAuth/RBAC**: Security gap for multi-user scenarios
5. **No staging environment**: Higher deployment risk
