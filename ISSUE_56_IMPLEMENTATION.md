# Issue #56 Implementation: Pipeline Visibility and Reliability Monitoring

## Summary

This document describes the comprehensive changes implemented to address Issue #56: "CRITICAL: Implement comprehensive pipeline visibility and reliability monitoring."

## Problem Statement

The crawler pipeline had the following visibility issues:
1. Discovery jobs completed silently with no stdout output visible in cloud logs
2. No way to monitor pipeline health across all 5 stages
3. No real-time progress indicators during processing
4. Difficult to identify bottlenecks and stalled stages
5. No centralized status command for troubleshooting

## Solution Overview

We implemented a comprehensive monitoring solution with three main components:

### 1. Real-Time Stdout Logging

All CLI commands now output progress to stdout in real-time, making them visible in Google Cloud Logs.

#### Modified Commands

**Discovery Command** (`src/cli/commands/discovery.py`)
- ✅ Startup banner with configuration
- ✅ Source status summary before processing
- ✅ Real-time progress per source: `✓ [23/157] Source Name: 42 new URLs`
- ✅ Error indicators: `✗ [23/157] Source Name: ERROR - Connection timeout`
- ✅ Failure analysis summary at completion

**Extraction Command** (`src/cli/commands/extraction.py`)
- ✅ Startup banner with batch configuration
- ✅ Batch progress: `📄 Processing batch 1/5...`
- ✅ Completion status per batch with metrics
- ✅ Rate limit warnings
- ✅ Cleaning progress indicators
- ✅ ChromeDriver efficiency stats

**Entity Extraction Command** (`src/cli/commands/entity_extraction.py`)
- ✅ Startup banner with configuration
- ✅ Article count discovered
- ✅ Progress every 10 articles: `✓ Progress: 20/87 articles processed`
- ✅ Completion summary

**Verification Command** (`src/cli/commands/verification.py` and `src/services/url_verification.py`)
- ✅ Startup banner
- ✅ Batch processing indicators
- ✅ Completion metrics per batch
- ✅ Success confirmation

### 2. Pipeline Status Command

Created a new comprehensive status command: `pipeline-status`

**Location**: `src/cli/commands/pipeline_status.py`

**Features**:
- 📊 Status check for all 5 pipeline stages
- 📈 Queue depth monitoring (pending items at each stage)
- ⏱️ Activity tracking (last N hours)
- ⚠️ Warning indicators for bottlenecks
- ✅ Overall health score (0-100%)
- 📝 Detailed breakdown by domain/source (optional)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Basic status
python -m src.cli.cli_modular pipeline-status

# Detailed breakdown
python -m src.cli.cli_modular pipeline-status --detailed

# Custom time window
python -m src.cli.cli_modular pipeline-status --hours 48
```

**Metrics Tracked**:

| Stage | Metrics |
|-------|---------|
| Discovery | Total sources, sources due, URLs discovered, discovery rate |
| Verification | Pending URLs, verified articles, verification rate |
| Extraction | Ready for extraction, total extracted, extraction rate, status breakdown |
| Entity Extraction | Ready for entities, articles with entities, entity extraction rate |
| Analysis | Ready for analysis, analyzed total, analysis rate |

**Health Indicators**:
- ✅ Healthy: 80-100% stages active
- ⚠️ Partially Active: 60-79% stages active
- ⚠️ Multiple Stalled: 40-59% stages active
- ❌ Stalled: 0-39% stages active

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

Created detailed monitoring documentation: `docs/PIPELINE_MONITORING.md`

**Contents**:
- Pipeline overview and stage descriptions
- Command usage examples with expected output
- Real-time logging examples for each command
- Monitoring best practices
- Daily health check procedures
- Debugging guides for stalled stages
- Backlog management strategies
- Error tracking and analysis
- Integration with Kubernetes
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Alert setup examples
- Future enhancement roadmap

docs/PIPELINE_MONITORING.md            - NEW: Complete documentation
```

### Code Patterns

All commands now follow this pattern:

```python
def handle_command(args) -> int:
    # 1. Print startup banner with configuration
    print("🚀 Starting [operation]...")
    print(f"   Config param: {value}")
    print()
    
    # 2. Process with real-time progress
    for item in items:
        # Processing...
        print(f"✓ [{current}/{total}] Item: result")
    
    # 3. Print completion summary
    print()
    print("✅ [Operation] completed successfully!")
    print(f"   Processed: {count}")
    print(f"   Errors: {errors}")
    
    return 0
```

### Database Queries

The pipeline-status command uses efficient queries to check each stage:

```sql
-- Discovery: Sources due for discovery
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.id)
FROM sources s
LEFT JOIN candidate_links cl ON s.id = cl.source_host_id
WHERE s.host IS NOT NULL
AND (cl.processed_at IS NULL OR cl.processed_at < datetime('now', '-7 days'))

-- Verification: Pending URLs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM candidate_links WHERE status = 'pending'

-- Extraction: Ready for extraction
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM candidate_links
WHERE status = 'article'
AND id NOT IN (SELECT candidate_link_id FROM articles WHERE candidate_link_id IS NOT NULL)

-- Entity Extraction: Articles needing entities
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM articles a
WHERE a.content IS NOT NULL
AND a.text IS NOT NULL
AND a.status NOT IN ('wire', 'opinion', 'obituary', 'error')
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM article_entities ae WHERE ae.article_id = a.id)

-- Analysis: Articles needing classification
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM articles a
WHERE a.status IN ('extracted', 'cleaned', 'local')
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM article_classifications ac WHERE ac.article_id = a.id)
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Discovery command outputs to stdout in real-time
- [x] Extraction command shows batch progress
- [x] Entity extraction shows progress every 10 articles
- [x] Verification shows batch completion
- [x] Pipeline-status command runs without errors
- [x] All Python files compile successfully
- [ ] Test in actual GCP Kubernetes environment
- [ ] Verify cloud logs capture stdout output
- [ ] Test pipeline-status on production database

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Syntax validation
python -m py_compile src/cli/commands/*.py

# Test help text
python -m src.cli.cli_modular pipeline-status --help

# Test with small batch
python -m src.cli.cli_modular discover-urls --source-limit 1
python -m src.cli.cli_modular extract --limit 1 --batches 1
python -m src.cli.cli_modular extract-entities --limit 1
python -m src.cli.cli_modular verify-urls --batch-size 10 --max-batches 1
```

## Deployment

### Kubernetes Integration

The changes are backward compatible and require no Kubernetes configuration changes. The existing CronJobs will automatically use the new logging once the updated images are deployed:

1. Build new images with changes:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-crawler.yaml
   gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-processor.yaml
   ```

2. Update CronJob images (if not using Cloud Deploy):
   ```bash
   kubectl set image cronjob/mizzou-crawler-discovery \
     crawler=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mizzou-news/images/crawler:${COMMIT_SHA}
   ```

3. Monitor logs in Google Cloud Console:
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=k8s_container" --limit 100
   ```

### Manual Testing in Kubernetes

```bash
# Create test job
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mizzou-crawler-discovery test-discovery

# Watch logs
kubectl logs -f job/test-discovery

# Check pipeline status
kubectl exec -it deployment/mizzou-processor -- \
  python -m src.cli.cli_modular pipeline-status
```

## Benefits
