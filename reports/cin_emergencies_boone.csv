No one was injured in a house fire Saturday morning in southeast Columbia, according to a Columbia Fire Department press release.

CFD was called to Stone Hill Drive around 6:15 a.m. on Saturday, the report states. Smoke was reported to be coming from the area, and the person who called 911 thought it may have been an outside fire.

Crews arrived within four minutes and found flames coming from a one-story house surrounded by heavy brush.

Firefighters used a ladder to enter the home through the windows, but found no victims inside. The blaze was under control in around 30 minutes.

The cause of the fire is under investigation. CFD spokesperson Katherine Rodriguez reminded drivers on Old 63 S to avoid the area as fire crews continue work at the scene Saturday afternoon."

See tracker.,"Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen as it moves across the Atlantic Ocean with forecasters expecting the storm to become a hurricane by Sunday.

The storm, given the name Gabrielle on Sept. 17, is moving northwestward at about 13 mph and is expected to have reached hurricane strength when it passes east of Bermuda beginning Sunday night, the National Hurricane Center said in an update at 11 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 20.

Gabrielle was positioned Saturday about 615 miles southeast of Bermuda and 540 miles northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands, which includes Anguilla, Montserrat and Saint Martin, the NHC said. Currently, the storm is producing maximum sustained winds of 60 mph with higher gusts, but is expected gradually strengthen.

Bermuda is beginning to be hit by swells generated by Gabrielle and those are expected to build over the weekend and will likely result in life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, the hurricane center said.

Swells are expected to hit beaches along the Atlantic coast, from North Carolina and north as far as the coast of Atlantic Canada; the swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, beginning late this weekend into early next week, the NHC said.

The NHC warned those on Bermuda to expect wind and rainfall from Gabrielle.

Gabrielle became the 7th named storm to form in the Atlantic basin this year – and the first named storm in the Atlantic since Aug. 28, an ""unprecedented dry spell"" during the usually busy hurricane season, WPLG-TV hurricane specialist Michael Lowry told USA TODAY at the time.

Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.

The hurricane center also is tracking an eastern Atlantic tropical wave off the western coast of Africa that forecasters say could slowly develop. But forecasters put its likelihood of formation at low through the next seven days.

The hurricane center is also monitoring two systems in the Eastern Pacific with disparate chances of developing into tropical depressions over the next few days.

Located a couple of hundred miles south of Mexico's southern coast is a ""broad area of low pressure,"" which is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms"" and will likely to develop into a tropical depression, the NHC said.

The system, which is moving west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph parallel to the country's coast, has a medium chance of developing over the next 48 hours and a high chance during the next 7 days, the center said.

Another system, labeled for tracking purposes as Invest 96L, located west of the Revillagigedo Islands (south of Cabo San Lucas), has weakened during the past 12 hours and the disturbance is now expected to have a low chance of development in the next 48 hours, the center said.

How do hurricanes form?

Hurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.

A tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.

Prepare now for hurricanes

Delaying potentially lifesaving preparations could mean waiting until it’s too late. ""Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends.

Develop an evacuation plan. If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.

Assemble disaster supplies. Whether you’re evacuating or sheltering in place, you’re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for a possibly lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.

Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions. Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance checkup to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance don’t cover flooding, so you’ll need a separate policy for those. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program.

Create a family communication plan. NOAA says you should take the time now to write down a hurricane plan and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.

Strengthen your home. Now is the time to improve your home’s ability to withstand hurricanes. Trim trees and install storm shutters, accordion shutters and impact glass, and seal outside wall openings.

KBIA,https://www.kbia.org/2025-09-20/trump-says-u-s-military-fatally-struck-another-alleged-drug-smuggling-boat,2025-09-20T00:00:00,Trump says U.S. military fatally struck another alleged drug-smuggling boat,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. military has carried out its third fatal strike against an alleged drug smuggling vessel this month.

Trump in a social media posting said the strike killed three and was carried out against a vessel ""affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility."" He did not provide more precise details about the location of the strike.

The Pentagon deferred questions about the strike to the White House, which did not respond to a request for clarity about the origins of the vessel.

""Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,"" Trump said in the post.

Trump also posted a video of the latest strike that shows a vessel speeding through waters before it appears to be struck by a pair of missiles from overhead and sink in a fiery explosion.

""It was at this moment, the narcoterrorists knew they screwed up,"" White House communications director Steven Cheung said on X in a posting with the video.

Trump on Monday announced the U.S. military had carried out a strike on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela. That strike also killed three on board.

That followed a Sept. 2 military strike on what the Trump administration said was a drug-carrying speedboat that killed 11. Trump claimed the boat was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, which was listed by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organization earlier this year.

The Trump administration has justified the military action as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.

But several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, as well as human rights groups have questioned the legality of Trump's action. They view it as a potential overreach of executive authority in part because the military was used for law enforcement purposes.

The Trump administration has yet to explain how the military assessed the boat's cargo and determined the passengers' alleged gang affiliation before the attacks on the vessels. National security officials told members of Congress that the first boat taken out was fired on multiple times after it had changed course and appeared headed back to shore.

The strikes follow a buildup of U.S. maritime forces in the Caribbean.

It marks a dramatic shift in how the U.S. is willing to combat drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere.

In Venezuela, some are speculating whether the strikes are part of a plan to try to topple President Nicolás Maduro, a notion that the Venezuelan leader has echoed.

Maduro claimed after the first strike that a U.S. video released by Trump was created with artificial intelligence and that a boat of that size cannot venture into the high seas.

But earlier this week Maduro lashed out at the U.S., accusing the Trump administration of using drug trafficking accusations as an excuse for a military operation whose intentions are ""to intimidate and seek regime change"" in the South American country.
