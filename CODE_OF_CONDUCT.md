# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-
economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
  mistakes, and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this
code of conduct.  Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the code of
conduct may be temporarily or permanently removed from the project at the
discretion of the project's leadership.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the project team at
`conduct@localnewsimpact.org`. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in
project spaces or in public spaces may be addressed when the project
leadership is made aware of the behavior.

## Enforcement

Consequences for violation of the Code of Conduct may include, but are
not limited to, a temporary or permanent ban from the project, removal
of commit or merge privileges, or other actions deemed appropriate by
project leadership.
