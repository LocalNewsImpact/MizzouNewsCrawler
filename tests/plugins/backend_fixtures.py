"""Plugin shim to expose backend Cloud SQL fixtures to top-level tests.

Pytest registers this module as a plugin via `pytest_plugins` in
`tests/conftest.py`. We import the actual fixtures from
`tests.backend.conftest` and re-export them under this module so they
become available without registering the full backend conftest as a
plugin (which can cause duplicate registration errors).
