## Branch Development Guidelines

### CI/CD Policy

**⚠️ CI is DISABLED for this branch during development**

- GitHub Actions CI will **NOT run** on commits to this branch
- CI is configured to only run on:
  - Pushes to `main`
  - Pull requests targeting `main`
- We will enable full CI testing during PR review before merging

**Why?**
- Rapid iteration without waiting for CI (20+ minute runs)
- Avoid unnecessary GitHub Actions minutes
- Focus on functionality first, testing second
- Full CI will run when PR is created

### Commit Strategy

**Local commits only** until ready for review:

```bash
# Commit locally
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"

# DO NOT push until phase complete or need backup
# git push  # ❌ Avoid during active development
```

**When to push:**
- ✅ Major phase milestone complete (want backup)
- ✅ Need to share work with others
- ✅ End of work session (optional backup)
- ✅ Ready for PR and code review

### Development Workflow

1. **Work locally**: Make changes, commit frequently
2. **Test locally**: **REQUIRED before every commit**
3. **Push milestone**: When phase complete or need backup
4. **Create PR**: Only when fully ready for review and merge
5. **CI runs**: Full testing happens during PR review

### ✅ Required Tests Before Every Commit

**Use the automated validation script (RECOMMENDED):**

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh

# If all pass, commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"

# Optional: Skip type checking (if needed)
SKIP_MYPY=1 ./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
```

**What gets checked:**

1. **Linting (ruff)** - Auto-formatted code style ✅
2. **Type checking (mypy)** - Type annotations (non-blocking ⚠️)
3. **Unit tests (pytest)** - 837 tests, 82.95% coverage ✅

**Manual commands (if needed):**

```bash
# 1. Static analysis (linting)
ruff check . --exclude scripts/manual_tests
ruff format .

# 2. Type checking (shows warnings, doesn't block)
mypy src/ backend/ --explicit-package-bases --ignore-missing-imports

# 3. Unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 4. Quick smoke test (optional)
pytest tests/ -v -k "not slow" --maxfail=3
```

**Why test locally?**

- ✅ Catch errors immediately, not in PR review
- ✅ Maintain code quality throughout development
- ✅ Faster feedback loop than waiting for CI
- ✅ Ensure tests pass before creating commits
- ✅ Avoid "fix tests" commits cluttering history

**Current test status:**
- ✅ Linting: All production code passes
- ⚠️ Type checking: Pre-existing issues (non-blocking)
- ✅ Unit tests: 837 passed, 2 skipped, 82.95% coverage

## Local Testing Commands

### Quick Pre-Commit Validation

**Use the automated script (RECOMMENDED):**

```bash
# Run all checks before committing
./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh

# If all pass, commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
```

This script runs:
1. Static analysis (ruff)
2. Type checking (mypy)
3. Unit tests (pytest)

### Test Docker Images

```bash
# Build all images
docker compose build

# Test API
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test crawler
docker compose run --rm crawler python -m src.cli.main discover-urls --source-limit 1

# Test processor
docker compose run --rm processor python -m src.cli.main extract --limit 5

# Clean up
docker compose down -v
```

### Manual Tests (No CI)

Since CI is disabled, run these manually before pushing:

```bash
# Linting
ruff check src/ backend/ tests/
black --check src/ backend/ tests/
mypy src/ backend/

# Unit tests
pytest tests/ --cov --cov-report=term-missing

# Security scan (if needed)
bandit -r src/ backend/
safety check --json
```

## Notes

- **Budget conscious**: Minimize cloud resource usage during development
- **Iterative approach**: Deploy phases incrementally
- **Test locally first**: Reduce cloud costs and iteration time
- **Document as you go**: Update this file with progress
