# PR Summary: Argo Workflows Integration for Pipeline Orchestration

## Overview

This PR implements Argo Workflows for production-grade pipeline orchestration, addressing Issue #79. The implementation provides automated extraction, verification, DAG visualization, per-step retry logic, and comprehensive observability.

## Problem Addressed

### Current Issues
- ❌ No automated extraction (only manual jobs)
- ❌ No verification automation
- ❌ Conflicting CronJobs with unclear purposes
- ❌ Poor visibility into pipeline progress
- ❌ No retry logic (must re-run entire pipeline on failure)
- ❌ Resource conflicts between jobs

### Solution Benefits
- ✅ DAG visualization with real-time UI
- ✅ Per-step retry (don't re-run entire pipeline)
- ✅ Kubernetes-native (uses existing infrastructure)
- ✅ Production-ready (used by Google, Intuit, SAP)
- ✅ Built-in metrics and logging
- ✅ Cost: ~$9/month additional for orchestration infrastructure

## Implementation Details

### Files Added

1. **RBAC Configuration** (`k8s/argo/rbac.yaml`)
   - ServiceAccount for workflows
   - Role with required permissions
   - RoleBinding for access control

2. **Mizzou Pipeline** (`k8s/argo/mizzou-pipeline-workflow.yaml`)
   - CronWorkflow: Every 6 hours at :00 (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)
   - Steps: Discovery → Verification → Extraction
   - Moderate rate limiting (5-15s between requests)
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

3. **Lehigh Pipeline** (`k8s/argo/lehigh-pipeline-workflow.yaml`)
   - CronWorkflow: Every 6 hours at :30 (00:30, 06:30, 12:30, 18:30 UTC)
   - Offset schedule to avoid conflicts
   - Aggressive rate limiting (90-180s) for Penn State bot protection
   - Extended CAPTCHA backoff (2-6 hours)

4. **Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy_argo_workflows.sh`)
   - Automated deployment with dry-run support
   - Pre-flight checks
   - Installation of Argo Workflows
   - Deployment verification

5. **Rollback Script** (`scripts/rollback_argo_workflows.sh`)
   - Safe rollback mechanism
   - Suspend workflows before deletion
   - Restore old CronJobs
   - Optional Argo uninstall

6. **Test Suite** (`tests/test_argo_workflows.py`)
   - 20 comprehensive tests
   - YAML structure validation
   - Metadata and configuration checks
   - Rate limiting verification
   - Environment variable validation

7. **Documentation**
   - `ARGO_WORKFLOWS_GUIDE.md`: Complete usage guide
   - `ARGO_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`: 7-phase deployment plan

## Pipeline Architecture

### Workflow Flow
```
Discovery (5-10 min)
    ↓ (conditional: on success)
Verification (10-30 min)
    ↓ (conditional: on success)
Extraction (30-60 min)
    ↓
Database: candidate_links → articles
```

### Status Transitions
```
Discovery:     NULL → discovered
Verification:  discovered → article
Extraction:    article → extracted
```

### Continuous Processor
The continuous processor deployment remains for internal processing:
- Cleaning: extracted → cleaned
- ML Analysis: cleaned → analyzed
- Entity Extraction: analyzed → entities

## Key Features

### 1. Conditional Execution
- Verification only runs if discovery succeeds
- Extraction only runs if verification succeeds
- Prevents wasted resources on incomplete pipelines

### 2. Retry Strategy
- Each step retries up to 2 times on failure
- Exponential backoff (5m → 10m → 20m)
- Only failed steps retry, not entire pipeline

### 3. Rate Limiting

**Mizzou (Moderate):**
- Inter-request: 5-15 seconds
- Batch sleep: 30 seconds
- CAPTCHA backoff: 30 min - 2 hours

**Lehigh (Aggressive):**
- Inter-request: 90-180 seconds
- Batch sleep: 7 minutes
- CAPTCHA backoff: 2-6 hours

### 4. Resource Management
- CPU requests: 200-250m per step
- CPU limits: 1000m per step
- Memory requests: 1-2Gi per step
- Memory limits: 3-4Gi per step

### 5. Observability
- Real-time DAG visualization in Argo UI
- Workflow status tracking
- Step-level logs
- Prometheus metrics
- Event tracking

## Testing

### Validation Completed
✅ YAML syntax validation
✅ Basic structure checks
✅ Metadata validation
✅ Environment variables
✅ Rate limiting configuration
✅ Resource limits
✅ RBAC permissions
✅ Dataset filtering
✅ Conditional execution logic
✅ Retry strategies

## Deployment

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Argo Workflows** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_argo_workflows.sh
   ```

2. **Access Argo UI** (optional)
   ```bash
   kubectl -n argo port-forward svc/argo-server 2746:2746
   # Open https://localhost:2746
   ```

3. **Monitor Workflows**
   ```bash
   kubectl get cronworkflow -n production
   kubectl get workflows -n production -w
   ```

# Re-enable old CronJobs
kubectl patch cronjob mizzou-discovery -n production -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
```

## Cost Analysis

| Component | Current | With Argo | Change |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| CronJobs | $20-25/mo | $0 (replaced) | -$20/mo |
| Argo controller | $0 | $3/mo | +$3/mo |
| Argo server (UI) | $0 | $5/mo | +$5/mo |
| Workflow storage | $0 | $1/mo | +$1/mo |
| Workflow execution | $0 | $20-25/mo | +$20/mo |
| **Total** | **$20-25/mo** | **$29-34/mo** | **+$9/mo** |

**ROI**: $9/month for production-grade orchestration, visibility, and reliability.

- Does not change database schema
- Does not modify continuous processor
- Can be fully rolled back

## Migration Path

### Parallel Operation Phase
1. Keep old CronJobs suspended (not deleted)
2. Run Argo workflows alongside
3. Monitor for 48 hours
4. Compare metrics

### Cutover Phase
1. If validation successful, delete old CronJobs
2. If issues arise, rollback to old CronJobs

## Dependencies

### Required
- kubectl access to GKE cluster
- Access to `production` namespace
- Existing secrets (database, proxy)

### Optional
- Argo CLI for local testing
- Port-forward access for UI

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Code review of YAML configurations and scripts
2. **Approval**: Get approval for production deployment
3. **Staging**: Test in staging environment (if available)
4. **Production**: Follow 7-phase deployment plan
5. **Monitoring**: Track metrics for 1-2 weeks
6. **Optimization**: Tune based on production feedback
