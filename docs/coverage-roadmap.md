# Test Coverage Roadmap (Baseline 2025-09-28)

## 1. Baseline metrics

Command: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=0`

- Total line coverage: **62%** (352 passed, 2 skipped)
- Coverage strengths: CLI command modules (`src/cli/cli_modular.py`, `src/cli/main.py`), reporting helpers, and several utility packages already exceed 90%.
- Immediate gaps concentrate in discovery/orchestration, service integrations, and large text-cleaning utilities.

> **Status legend:** ‚úÖ Completed ¬∑ ‚è≥ In progress ¬∑ üîú Planned

| Module | Coverage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/crawler/discovery.py` | 56% | Core discovery engine; heavy branching across RSS, homepage, newspaper4k, storysniffer, and recent URL normalization. |
| `src/crawler/__init__.py` | 70% | Shared crawler helpers; still below 75% target. |
| `src/crawler/scheduling.py` | 51% | Retry window logic and host throttling under-tested. |
| `src/services/url_verification.py` | 44% | Critical batching/backoff logic missing edge-case coverage. |
| `src/models/database.py` | 69% | Fresh unit isolation now covers candidate/article upserts plus lock contention retry helpers. |
| `src/reporting/county_reporter.py` | 72% | New regression tests exercise CSV/XLSX export flows and guard wire attribution serialization. |
| `src/cli/commands/content_cleaning.py` | 60% | Multiple execution paths with complex flag handling. |
| `src/cli/commands/extraction.py` | 60% | Needs coverage for failure fallbacks and batch controls. |
| `src/cli/commands/extraction_backup.py` | 40% | Sparse tests; high priority before Kubernetes migration. |
| `src/utils/content_cleaner_balanced.py` | 45% | Large rule-set; candidates for property-based/unit sampling. |
| `src/utils/content_cleaner_twophase.py` | 12% | Essentially untested; consider pruning or covering. |
| `src/utils/url_utils.py` | 86% | Recently added dedupe normalization tests lifted coverage. |
| `src/pipeline/text_cleaning.py` | 89% | Strong coverage‚Äîserves as model for other pipeline modules. |

### Baseline actions

## 2. Golden-path audit (must hit 100% via smoke/E2E)

Status key: ‚úÖ completed ¬∑ ‚è≥ in progress ¬∑ üîú planned

### Discovery ‚Üí Candidate storage

  - 2025-09-30: Added telemetry-focused unit tests covering storysniffer success/failure handling and newspaper4k NO_FEED fallbacks.
  - 2025-09-30: Added mixed-outcome regression ensuring telemetry persistence in `tests/e2e/test_discovery_pipeline.py::test_run_discovery_records_mixed_outcome_in_telemetry`.
  - 2025-10-03: Added `tests/e2e/test_discovery_pipeline.py::test_multi_source_prioritization_telemetry` to exercise multi-source discovery (RSS + homepage + storysniffer) and assert aggregated telemetry covers site failure logging plus mixed-method prioritization heuristics.
- ‚è≥ In progress
  - _None ‚Äî continuing to monitor regression dashboards for newly introduced discovery sources._

### Verification batching

- ‚úÖ Completed
  - `tests/services/test_url_verification.py` exercises batching & counters.
  - 2025-09-28: Added HTTP failure coverage (timeouts and HTTP 5xx) with retry assertions.
  - 2025-10-03: Added multi-batch dequeue regression ensuring retry exhaustion still persists telemetry via `tests/services/test_url_verification.py::test_multi_batch_retry_exhaustion_persists_telemetry` and companion smoke coverage in `tests/e2e/test_discovery_pipeline.py`.
- üîú Planned
  - Expand load-shedding coverage for long-lived verification queues (blocked on async worker refactor).

### Extraction ‚Üí Gazetteer enrichment ‚Üí Analysis

- ‚úÖ Completed
  - Partial coverage via extraction command tests and county pipeline smoke runs.
  - 2025-09-30: Added `tests/e2e/test_extraction_analysis_pipeline.py` to seed SQLite, stub extraction/cleaning/entity services, run `handle_extraction_command`, apply ML labels, and assert county report output with telemetry + gazetteer matches.
  - 2025-10-02: Added extractor failure/gazetteer-miss regression coverage and aligned the ORM `Article.wire` column with reporting SQL usage via reusable E2E harness helpers.

### County orchestration task

- ‚úÖ Completed
  - CLI tests cover argument parsing; pipeline smoke run verifies process startup.
  - 2025-10-01: Added `tests/e2e/test_county_pipeline_golden_path.py` to drive discovery ‚Üí verification ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí analysis with deterministic stubs and assert telemetry, reports, and queue transitions.
  - 2025-10-03: Scoped failure-path scenarios for multi-county orchestration loops and verification retry exhaustion, capturing requirements in `docs/coverage-roadmap.md` and aligning fixtures with queue telemetry expectations.
  - 2025-10-04: Implemented `tests/e2e/test_county_pipeline_failure_paths.py` exercising multi-county dequeue loops, forced verification retry exhaustion, and asserting telemetry persistence plus recovery routing.
- ‚è≥ In progress

- üîú Planned
  - Extend county pipeline harness to stress-test load shedding during simultaneous severe weather alerts.

### Telemetry API/reporting

- ‚úÖ Completed
  - API unit tests exist with mocked DB to validate endpoints.
  - 2025-10-03: Finalized telemetry E2E scenario design, enumerating discovery/extraction dashboard assertions and wiring fixtures into the shared harness.
  - 2025-10-04: Added `tests/e2e/test_telemetry_dashboard_golden_path.py` verifying discovery/extraction updates persist to dashboards and guarding against regression via snapshot comparisons.
- ‚è≥ In progress
  - _None ‚Äî continuing to monitor dashboard regressions._
- üîú Planned
  - Extend telemetry coverage to include failure-path dashboards (e.g., verification outage alerts) once new extraction harness fixtures stabilize.

_Outcome goal:_ introduce pytest E2E suites (`tests/e2e/test_pipeline_xxx.py`) with seeded SQLite + stubbed external services to cover each primary success narrative.

## 3. External integrations & failure modes

| Dependency | Interaction | Current tests | Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP RSS feeds (`requests`, `feedparser`) | Fetch & parse feeds; handle 3xx/4xx/5xx, timeouts. | Unit tests mostly mock happy path. | Need contract tests for status codes, slow responses, malformed XML, retries/skip logic. |
| `newspaper4k` subprocess | CPU-heavy article discovery via multiprocessing. | Limited unit coverage (stubbed). | Add tests for timeouts, build-disabled branches, temporary file cleanup. |
| StorySniffer | ML prediction for homepage scraping. | Minimal coverage through unit mocks. | Add integration test with sample HTML + failure prediction to assert filtering. |
| Gazetteer service | HTTP API for geographic enrichment. | `tests/test_gazetteer_integration.py` uses local fixtures. | Expand to cover rate limiting, 5xx, and schema drift. |
| Verification service | External HTTP call for URL health. | Unit tests stub successes; no network fault cases. | Add integration harness to simulate 429/500, exponential backoff, and permanent failure classification. |
| SQLite/Postgres access (`sqlalchemy`) | Upserts, retries, lock handling. | Some unit coverage in `tests/models/test_database_manager.py`. | Add tests simulating lock contention & transaction rollbacks. |
| NLP/Extraction (`spacy`, custom models) | Content extraction + labeling. | Real-world extraction tests exist but rely on live network for some URLs. | Introduce cached HTML fixtures + offline model invocation to ensure determinism. |
| Telemetry API (FastAPI) | REST endpoints for metrics. | API tests exist. | Add failures for DB downtime and schema migration mismatches. |

## 4. Roadmap to target coverage (pre-Kubernetes)

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Integration & resilience harness (Weeks 5‚Äì7)

#### üîú Planned

- Create reusable HTTP stub server fixtures to emulate external services (RSS, Gazetteer, Verification).
- Add tests for timeout, retry exhaustion, and schema drift; document contracts.
- Expand to `spacy`/ML extraction by caching inference outputs.

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Enforcement & maintenance (Weeks 7‚Äì8)

- Raise `--cov-fail-under` incrementally (65% ‚Üí 70% ‚Üí 75%).

- Evaluate mutation testing or diff coverage checks for critical modules.

## 5. Success criteria

- **Unit tests:** Core crawler, service, and CLI modules sustain 75‚Äì85% line coverage with stable suites.
- **Golden paths:** Every primary pipeline flow validated end-to-end in <5 minutes of runtime with deterministic fixtures.
- **Integrations:** Each external dependency has at least one integration test exercising success and critical failure modes.
- **Governance:** Coverage gates enforced in CI with dashboards shared ahead of Kubernetes migration.
