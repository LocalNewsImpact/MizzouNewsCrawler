# Test Coverage Roadmap (Baseline 2025-09-30)

## 1. Baseline metrics

Command: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70`

- Total line coverage: **69.97%** (477 passed, 2 skipped). The gate remains at `--cov-fail-under=70`, so the most recent full-suite run tripped the threshold by **0.03 percentage points**; follow-up work below targets low-coverage modules to clear the bar.
- Coverage strengths: CLI surface area, telemetry store, and most utility packages continue to exceed 85% line coverage thanks to the existing unit suites.
- Immediate gaps remain in discovery edge cases (homepage/storysniffer fallbacks), scheduling heuristics, and portions of the crawler orchestration glue code.

> **Known skips:** `tests/test_versioning_concurrent_stress.py` and `tests/test_versioning_postgres.py` remain skip-marked pending Postgres fixture availability. No failing tests in the latest run.

| Module | Coverage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/crawler/discovery.py` | 61% | Happy-path, mixed, duplicate-only, and RSS outage E2E tests now land; homepage/storysniffer fallbacks still sparse. |
| `src/crawler/__init__.py` | 71% | Shared crawler helpers inching toward the 75% gate; driver lifecycle paths remain uncovered. |
| `src/crawler/scheduling.py` | 74% | Frequency matrix, metadata fallbacks, host-limit pruning, and existing-article thresholds now exercised by unit + due-only E2E suites; telemetry failure-path drills remain. |
| `src/services/url_verification.py` | 71% | Timeout/backoff and GET fallback flows covered; long-lived load-shedding remains in backlog. |
| `src/services/url_verification_worker.py` | 94% | Async worker load-shedding + recovery scenarios covered via service-level tests. |
| `src/models/database.py` | 66% | Upsert/lock regression suite landed; schema drift helpers remain untested. |
| `src/reporting/county_report.py` | 97% | County report coverage now guards CSV export + wire attribution joins. |
| `src/cli/commands/gazetteer.py` | 68% | New geocode cache throttling tests cover wait/backoff; request failure/backfill flow still pending. |
| `src/cli/commands/content_cleaning.py` | 79% | CLI flag permutations largely covered; streaming-mode regressions outstanding. |
| `src/cli/commands/extraction.py` | 85% | Failure fallbacks + batch controls validated via CLI and E2E harnesses. |
| `src/cli/commands/extraction_backup.py` | 93% | Backup command now tied into shared fixtures. |
| `src/cli/commands/crawl.py` | 95% | Legacy alias now backed by targeted CLI tests; forwarding defaults and validation thoroughly covered. |
| `src/cli/commands/http_status.py` | 98% | CLI fixtures exercise source/host filtering, lookup resolution, JSON output, and error logging. |
| `src/utils/content_cleaner_balanced.py` | 59% | Rule-set still has large gaps around outlier HTML normalization; follow-up fixtures required. |
| `src/utils/content_cleaner_twophase.py` | 88% | Recent fixture refactor lifted baseline. |
| `src/utils/url_utils.py` | 86% | Dedupe normalization tests preserve high coverage. |
| `src/pipeline/text_cleaning.py` | 89% | Remains the gold standard for pipeline module coverage. |
| `src/telemetry/store.py` | 98% | Async flush, schema caching, and singleton guard remain well covered. |

### Baseline actions

- ‚úÖ 2025-09-28: Upload `coverage.xml` to CI artifact store via GitHub Actions `coverage-<python>` artifact.
- ‚úÖ 2025-09-28: Emit `coverage-summary.md` per run for module-level review in pull requests.
- ‚úÖ 2025-09-30: Full-suite coverage run (477 passed, 2 skipped, 69.97% total) archived to `coverage.xml`; next delta focuses on `src/cli/commands/gazetteer.py` and `src/models/database.py` hot spots to clear the 70% gate in CI.

## 2. Golden-path audit (must hit 100% via smoke/E2E)

_Outcome goal:_ introduce pytest E2E suites (`tests/e2e/test_pipeline_xxx.py`) with seeded SQLite + stubbed external services to cover each primary success narrative.

## 3. External integrations & failure modes

| Dependency | Interaction | Current tests | Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP RSS feeds (`requests`, `feedparser`) | Fetch & parse feeds; handle 3xx/4xx/5xx, timeouts. | Unit tests mostly mock happy path. | Need contract tests for status codes, slow responses, malformed XML, retries/skip logic. |
| `newspaper4k` subprocess | CPU-heavy article discovery via multiprocessing. | Limited unit coverage (stubbed). | Add tests for timeouts, build-disabled branches, temporary file cleanup. |
| StorySniffer | ML prediction for homepage scraping. | Minimal coverage through unit mocks. | Add integration test with sample HTML + failure prediction to assert filtering. |
| Gazetteer service | HTTP API for geographic enrichment. | `tests/test_gazetteer_integration.py` uses local fixtures; `tests/test_geocode_cache.py` covers throttling waits/backoff. | Extend to 5xx handling and schema drift scenarios. |
| Verification service | External HTTP call for URL health. | Unit tests now cover batching, timeout/backoff, 403 fallback, and simulated 429/5xx responses. | Extend coverage to async worker load-shedding once the refactor lands. |
| SQLite/Postgres access (`sqlalchemy`) | Upserts, retries, lock handling. | Some unit coverage in `tests/models/test_database_manager.py`. | Add tests simulating lock contention & transaction rollbacks. |
| NLP/Extraction (`spacy`, custom models) | Content extraction + labeling. | Real-world extraction tests exist but rely on live network for some URLs. | Introduce cached HTML fixtures + offline model invocation to ensure determinism. |
| Telemetry API (FastAPI) | REST endpoints for metrics. | API tests exist. | Add failures for DB downtime and schema migration mismatches. |

## 4. Roadmap to target coverage (pre-Kubernetes)

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Institutionalize metrics (Week 1)

  - ‚úÖ 2025-10-02: Hardened `tests/services/test_url_verification.py` with HTTP 5xx retry, timeout, and telemetry/metrics assertions; verified service loop honors limits and failure bookkeeping.
- ‚úÖ **Mandatory** `src/models/database.py`: unit-test upsert flows with simulated lock contention and ensure ORM compatibility with reporting outputs.
  - ‚úÖ 2025-09-28: Added targeted upsert coverage in `tests/models/test_database_manager.py`, simulating lock contention, verifying retry counters, and asserting metadata/wire persistence for reporting.
- ‚úÖ **Mandatory** reporting exports: guard CSV/XLSX generation and data joins for county output pipelines.
  - ‚úÖ 2025-09-28: Landed `tests/reporting/test_county_report.py` and `tests/reporting/test_csv_writer.py` with shared fixtures to validate DataFrame transforms, wire attribution, and filesystem cleanup.

  - ‚úÖ 2025-09-29: Removed URL-slug headline fallback from the crawler and added regression coverage to ensure fields remain null or empty arrays when extraction methods cannot populate them.
  - ‚úÖ 2025-10-05: Added `tests/cli/commands/test_crawl.py` to lock in legacy alias validation, forwarding defaults, and ALL filter wiring; `crawl` command now sits at 95% coverage.

#### ‚è≥ In progress

- ‚úÖ 2025-09-29: Achieved 100% line coverage across discovery ‚Üí verification ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí analysis orchestration surfaces via expanded `tests/test_county_pipeline.py` (CLI flag wiring, `_run_cli_step` dry-run/error handling, module entrypoint).
