# README Update Summary - Issue #102

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Issue**: [#102 - Audit and update README documentation to reflect current system architecture](https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler/issues/102)

## Overview

The README.md file has been completely updated to accurately reflect the current production architecture, deployment model, and operational status of the MizzouNewsCrawler system.

## Major Changes

### 1. Updated System Architecture Description

**Before**: Described the system as a "CSV-to-Database-driven production version with SQLite backend" with a two-phase approach (Phase 1 — Script-based, Phase 2 — Production as future goals).

**After**: Accurately describes the current production deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with:
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster `mizzou-cluster` in `us-central1-a`
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (`mizzou-db-prod`) with Cloud SQL Connector
- Argo Workflows orchestration with CronWorkflow scheduling
- Artifact Registry for container images
- Cloud Build CI/CD automation

### 2. Added Production Architecture Documentation

New sections include:
- **System Architecture**: Detailed GCP/Kubernetes infrastructure
- **Deployed Services**: API, Processor, and Argo Workflows
- **Pipeline Components**: Complete data flow from discovery to BigQuery export
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Visual representation of the pipeline stages

### 3. Documented Recent Fixes and Improvements

Added comprehensive documentation of bug fixes from issue #102:
- **Verification System**: Fixed exit_on_idle logic and wait-for-candidates SQL query
- **Bot Protection**: Fixed false positives on reCAPTCHA elements
- **Article Status Tracking**: Fixed status field updates and backfilled 6,235 articles
- **Data Integrity**: Added unique constraints and ON CONFLICT handling

### 4. Updated Deployment Documentation

- Removed outdated "Phase 1/Phase 2" references
- Added production deployment procedures with Cloud Build
- Documented container images and Kubernetes resources
- Added configuration and secrets management details
- Updated environment variables for Cloud SQL Connector

### 5. Enhanced Workflow Documentation

**Production Workflow**: Documented the automated Argo Workflows pipeline:
1. Discovery Phase (Argo)
2. Verification Phase (Argo)
3. Extraction Phase (Argo)
4. Cleaning Phase (Processor)
5. ML Analysis Phase (Processor)
6. Entity Extraction Phase (Processor)
7. BigQuery Export

**Local Development Workflow**: Maintained instructions for SQLite-based local development

### 6. Added Monitoring and Operations Section

New sections for operational awareness:
- Current operational status with service health indicators
- Known gaps in observability (Phase 8 incomplete)
- Monitoring commands for Argo Workflows, Processor, and API
- Known issues and limitations
- Links to operational procedures

### 7. Updated Roadmap

- Moved completed features to "Completed Features" section
- Clearly identified Phase 8 (Observability & Monitoring) as high priority
- Listed planned enhancements with issue references

### 8. Improved Documentation Structure

- Added comprehensive "Documentation" section with links to key docs
- Created "Contributing & Development" section with clear guidelines
- Added "Support and Community" section
- Reorganized content for better flow and readability
- Removed duplicate sections and outdated references

### 9. Enhanced Installation and Quick Start

- Updated prerequisites for both local development and production
- Added Docker-based development option
- Included environment configuration instructions
- Separated local development from production status checks

### 10. Added Reference Links

Created comprehensive documentation index with links to:
- Architecture & Deployment docs
- Operations runbooks
- Development guides
- Templates and tools

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Complete rewrite with 477 insertions, 154 deletions

## Validation

- ✅ All documentation links verified to exist
- ✅ Markdown linting passed (1 trailing whitespace issue fixed)
- ✅ No security issues detected (CodeQL scan)
- ✅ Production architecture accurately reflected

## What Was NOT Changed

The following sections were preserved as they are still accurate:
- CLI Usage commands (extensive command reference)
- Content processing and quality assurance details
- Telemetry system documentation
- Content cleaning tools and techniques
- Gazetteer integration details
- LLM summarization pipeline
- Database schema information

## Addressing Issue #102 Checklist

### System Architecture ✅
- [x] Documented current GCP infrastructure (GKE, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry, Secret Manager)
- [x] Mapped deployed Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, CronWorkflows)
- [x] Documented data flow through pipeline stages
- [x] Listed environment variables and configuration sources

### Recent Fixes ✅
- [x] Documented verification system fixes
- [x] Documented bot protection improvements
- [x] Documented article status tracking fixes
- [x] Documented data integrity enhancements

### Documentation Updates ✅
- [x] Updated README with GCP/Kubernetes deployment model
- [x] Added data flow description
- [x] Updated configuration guide (environment variables, secrets)
- [x] Added section on recent fixes and improvements
- [x] Provided links to operational procedures

### Operational Status ✅
- [x] Listed known issues and workarounds
- [x] Documented monitoring procedures (manual checks)
- [x] Listed operational components with status indicators

### Known Gaps (Documented) ✅
- [x] Identified Phase 8 (Observability & Monitoring) gaps
- [x] Noted missing Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- [x] Noted missing automated alerting
- [x] Noted unclear frontend deployment status

## Next Steps

While the README is now up to date, the following items from issue #102 remain:

1. **BigQuery Export Verification**: Verify export mechanism (appears to be Data Transfer Service)
2. **Frontend Deployment Status**: Clarify dashboard deployment status
3. **Architecture Diagram**: Create visual architecture diagram showing current system
4. **Phase 8 Implementation**: Complete Observability & Monitoring phase
5. **Network Policies**: Configure network policies for security

These items should be tracked as separate tasks or issues.

## Conclusion

The README.md now accurately reflects the current production architecture and provides comprehensive guidance for both operators and developers. All major gaps identified in issue #102 related to documentation have been addressed.
