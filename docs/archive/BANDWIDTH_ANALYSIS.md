## Detailed Analysis

### Extraction Statistics (Last 30 Days)

```
Total articles extracted: 4,226
Days with data: 12
Articles per day: 352 (30-day avg)
Articles per day: 229 (7-day avg) ← Down 34.9% due to bot blocking
Avg content size (cleaned): 3.1 KB
```

### Bandwidth Per Article

```
Stored content (cleaned text):  3.1 KB
Raw HTML downloaded (estimate): 7.6 KB
HTML overhead multiplier:       2.5x
```

**Reasoning:** Raw HTML includes:
- HTTP headers (~1-2 KB)
- JavaScript libraries and inline scripts
- CSS stylesheets and inline styles
- Navigation, ads, social media widgets
- Comments, related articles sections
- Meta tags, tracking pixels

Typical ratio of raw HTML to cleaned text: 2-3x

## Cost Analysis (Assuming Typical Proxy Pricing)

### Common Proxy Pricing Models

**1. Pay-per-GB (Residential Proxies)**
- Typical cost: $5-15 per GB
- Our usage (normal): 0.42 GB/month = **$2-6/month**
- Our usage (high): 1.9 GB/month = **$10-30/month**

**2. Pay-per-Request (Datacenter Proxies)**
- Typical cost: $0.001-0.003 per request
- Our requests (normal): ~400-500/day = **$12-45/month**
- Our requests (high): ~1,000/day = **$30-90/month**

**3. Unlimited Plans**
- Typical cost: $50-200/month for unlimited bandwidth
- May have concurrent connection limits
- Usually most cost-effective at scale

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Current Bandwidth Usage is LOW
- **Current:** ~30 MB/day (~0.9 GB/month)
- **Normal operations:** ~14 MB/day (~0.42 GB/month)
- Even at peak (123 MB/day), this is modest for web scraping

### 2. Selenium Overhead is Significant
- **Requests-only:** 2-6 MB/day
- **With Selenium:** 20-100 MB/day (4-20x higher)
- Selenium loads full pages (images, CSS, JS, fonts)
- Consider: Only use Selenium for bot-blocked sites

### 3. Failed Attempts Add Overhead
- Failed requests still consume 20-50 KB each
- At 95% failure rate: ~5 MB/day in wasted bandwidth
- Intelligent backoff/skipping can reduce waste

### 4. Discovery is Efficient
- RSS/sitemap crawling: 2.5-5 MB/day
- HEAD requests: 0.1-1 MB/day
- Combined: <20% of total bandwidth

### 5. Bandwidth Scales with Volume
- Linear scaling for requests-based extraction
- Selenium adds ~50-100 KB per article (with assets)
- 1,000 articles/day = ~123 MB/day (manageable)

## Recommendations

### 1. Optimize Selenium Usage
**Current:** Selenium attempts all bot-blocked sites  
**Recommendation:** Use Selenium selectively
- Only for high-value articles
- Only after requests fails
- Skip after 3 consecutive Selenium failures
- **Potential savings:** 50-80% of Selenium bandwidth

### 2. Implement Intelligent Backoff
**Current:** Retry failed domains  
**Recommendation:** Skip persistently blocked domains
- Exponential backoff for CAPTCHA
- Daily/weekly retry for persistent blocks
- **Potential savings:** 30-50% of failed attempt bandwidth

### 3. Cache Discovery Results
**Current:** Daily RSS/sitemap fetches  
**Recommendation:** Cache feed content
- Only fetch if Last-Modified/ETag changed
- Use HTTP 304 Not Modified
- **Potential savings:** 20-40% of discovery bandwidth

### 4. Monitor Bandwidth Usage
**Current:** No direct bandwidth monitoring  
**Recommendation:** Add telemetry
- Track response_size_bytes for all requests
- Alert on unusual spikes
- Dashboard for daily/monthly usage

### 5. Consider Proxy Plan Based on Volume

**For Current Volume (<1 GB/month):**
- Pay-per-GB residential proxies: $5-15/month
- OR datacenter rotating proxies: $10-30/month

**For High Volume (1-5 GB/month):**
- Unlimited datacenter plan: $50-100/month
- OR pay-per-GB: $5-75/month

**For Peak Volume (>5 GB/month):**
- Unlimited residential proxies: $150-300/month
- OR dedicated proxy pool

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Daily Bandwidth
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as articles,
    AVG(LENGTH(content))::numeric * 2.5 / 1024 as avg_kb,
    SUM(LENGTH(content))::numeric * 2.5 / (1024*1024) as total_mb
FROM articles
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
AND content IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Track Extraction Attempts
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
    SUM(response_size_bytes) / (1024*1024) as total_mb
FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Selenium Usage
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE primary_method = 'selenium') as selenium_used,
    COUNT(*) as total_extractions,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE primary_method = 'selenium') / COUNT(*), 1) as selenium_pct
FROM extraction_telemetry_v2
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## Conclusion

**Current bandwidth usage is very low** (~0.4-0.9 GB/month), making this an extremely cost-effective scraping operation. Even at 10x scale, bandwidth costs would remain under $100/month with typical proxy pricing.

**Key cost drivers:**
1. **Selenium usage** (4-20x higher bandwidth per article)
2. **Failed extraction attempts** (wasted bandwidth on errors)
3. **Bot blocking** (forces expensive Selenium fallback)

**Optimization priority:**
1. Fix bot blocking issues (reduce failed attempts)
2. Use Selenium selectively (only when necessary)
3. Implement intelligent backoff (skip persistent failures)

With the cleaning command now deployed, we should see extraction success rates improve, which will reduce wasted bandwidth from failed attempts.
