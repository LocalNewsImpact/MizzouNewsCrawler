# ML Model Reloading Issue Analysis

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** spaCy ML model loaded repeatedly, causing 2GB memory spikes  
**Impact:** OOM kills, inefficient memory usage, slower processing

---

## Root Cause

### The Problem

**The ML model (spaCy `en_core_web_sm`) is being reloaded once per batch** instead of being cached in memory.

### Why It Happens

The continuous processor (`orchestration/continuous_processor.py`) spawns a **new subprocess** for each entity extraction batch:

```python
# continuous_processor.py line 134-145
def run_cli_command(command: list[str], description: str) -> bool:
    cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", CLI_MODULE, *command]
    
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        cmd,  # ← New Python process!
        cwd=PROJECT_ROOT,
        env=env,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
        text=True,
    )
```

Each subprocess:
1. **Fresh Python interpreter** - Empty memory
2. **Fresh import cache** - All `@lru_cache` decorators reset
3. **Loads spaCy model** - ~2GB memory spike
4. **Processes 100 articles** - Uses cached model (good!)
5. **Exits** - Releases all memory
6. **Repeat** - Next batch starts fresh from step 1

### Current Caching (Doesn't Help)

```python
# src/pipeline/entity_extraction.py line 68-70
@lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def _load_spacy_model(model_name: str):
    logger.info("Loading spaCy model %s", model_name)
    return spacy.load(model_name)
```

This **works within a single process** (all 100 articles in a batch share the model), but **doesn't persist across batches** because each batch is a new process.

---

## Impact Analysis

### Memory Usage Pattern

**Current (inefficient):**
```
Batch 1 process:
  0s:     Load model → 2.2GB memory spike
  2s:     Process articles (100) → Model cached in RAM
  30s:    Exit → Memory freed

Batch 2 process:
  0s:     Load model → 2.2GB memory spike AGAIN
  2s:     Process articles (100) → Model cached in RAM  
  30s:    Exit → Memory freed

... repeat forever
```

**Optimal (what we want):**
```
Long-running process:
  0s:     Load model → 2.2GB memory (ONE TIME)
  2s:     Process batch 1 (100 articles)
  32s:    Process batch 2 (100 articles)  ← Model already in RAM!
  62s:    Process batch 3 (100 articles)  ← Model already in RAM!
  ... forever, model stays loaded
```

### Waste Calculation

**Per Batch:**
- Model load time: ~2 seconds
- Model load I/O: ~500MB disk read
- Memory spike: 2.2GB

**Per Hour:**
- Entity extraction runs every ~5 minutes (12 times/hour)
- **24 seconds wasted loading** (12 × 2s)
- **6GB disk I/O wasted** (12 × 500MB)
- **12 memory spikes** → potential OOM triggers

**Per Day:**
- **288 model loads** (24h × 12/hour)
- **10 minutes wasted loading** (288 × 2s)
- **144GB disk I/O wasted** (288 × 500MB)

---

## Solutions

### Option 1: Direct Function Call (RECOMMENDED)

**Change:** Import and call the function directly instead of subprocess.

**Implementation:**

```python
# orchestration/continuous_processor.py

# Add at top
from src.cli.commands.entity_extraction import handle_entity_extraction_command
from argparse import Namespace

# Initialize extractor ONCE at startup
_entity_extractor = None

def get_entity_extractor():
    """Lazy-load and cache the entity extractor."""
    global _entity_extractor
    if _entity_extractor is None:
        from src.pipeline.entity_extraction import ArticleEntityExtractor
        _entity_extractor = ArticleEntityExtractor()
    return _entity_extractor

# Replace process_entity_extraction()
def process_entity_extraction(count: int) -> bool:
    """Run entity extraction directly (no subprocess)."""
    if count == 0:
        return False

    limit = min(count, GAZETTEER_BATCH_SIZE)
    
    # Create args namespace instead of CLI command
    args = Namespace(limit=limit, source=None)
    
    # Inject the cached extractor to avoid reloading model
    try:
        logger.info("▶️  Entity extraction (%d pending, limit %d)", count, limit)
        extractor = get_entity_extractor()  # ← Uses cached model!
        
        # Call the function directly
        # TODO: Refactor handle_entity_extraction_command to accept extractor
        result = handle_entity_extraction_command(args)
        
        if result == 0:
            logger.info("✅ Entity extraction completed successfully")
            return True
        else:
            logger.error("❌ Entity extraction failed")
            return False
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Entity extraction failed: %s", e)
        return False
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Model loaded **once** at startup
- ✅ Zero subprocess overhead
- ✅ Immediate 10min/day savings
- ✅ Eliminates memory spikes
- ✅ Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Shared memory space (but we have 14GB now, so fine)
- ⚠️ Requires small refactor of `handle_entity_extraction_command`

---

### Option 2: Persistent Worker Daemon

**Change:** Run entity extraction as a separate long-lived process that accepts jobs via queue.

**Architecture:**
```
continuous_processor.py
  ↓ (sends message)
Redis/Queue
  ↓ (receives message)
entity_worker.py (long-running)
  └─ spaCy model loaded ONCE
  └─ Processes jobs from queue
```

**Implementation sketch:**

```python
# orchestration/entity_worker.py (NEW FILE)

from src.pipeline.entity_extraction import ArticleEntityExtractor
from src.models.database import DatabaseManager
import time

class EntityExtractionWorker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load model ONCE at startup
        self.extractor = ArticleEntityExtractor()
        self.db = DatabaseManager()
        
    def process_batch(self, limit: int):
        """Process a batch using the cached extractor."""
        # Same logic as handle_entity_extraction_command
        # but using self.extractor (already loaded!)
        pass
    
    def run(self):
        """Main worker loop."""
        while True:
            # Check for work (from queue, DB, etc.)
            count = self.get_pending_count()
            if count > 0:
                self.process_batch(min(count, 100))
            time.sleep(10)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    worker = EntityExtractionWorker()
    worker.run()
```

**Deploy:**
```yaml
# k8s/entity-worker-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: entity-worker
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: mizzou-processor:latest
        command: ["python", "orchestration/entity_worker.py"]
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 2.5Gi  # Model stays loaded
          limits:
            memory: 4Gi
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Model loaded once, never reloaded
- ✅ Can scale to multiple workers
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Enables async job queue patterns

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex architecture
- ⚠️ Needs queue infrastructure (Redis/Pub/Sub)
- ⚠️ Higher operational overhead

---

### Option 3: Increase Batch Size

**Change:** Process more articles per batch (reduce batch frequency).

```python
# orchestration/continuous_processor.py

# Current
GAZETTEER_BATCH_SIZE = 100  # Reload model every 100 articles

# Proposed
GAZETTEER_BATCH_SIZE = 500  # Reload model every 500 articles
```

**Impact:**
- Current: 288 model loads/day (assuming 28,800 articles/day)
- Proposed: 58 model loads/day (assuming 28,800 articles/day)
- **Savings: 80% reduction in reloads!**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplest fix (one line change)
- ✅ Immediate 80% reduction in waste
- ✅ No architectural changes

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Longer-running processes (more risk of interruption)
- ⚠️ Still not optimal (still reloading, just less often)
- ⚠️ Doesn't scale as data grows

---

### Option 4: Move to Batch Job (2 AM Daily)

**Change:** Run entity extraction once per day during off-peak hours.

```yaml
# k8s/entity-extraction-cronjob.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: entity-extraction-batch
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM daily
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: entity-extractor
            image: mizzou-processor:latest
            command:
            - python
            - -m
            - src.cli.main
            - extract-entities
            - --limit
            - "10000"  # Process all pending
            resources:
              requests:
                memory: 3Gi
              limits:
                memory: 6Gi
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Model loaded once per day (1 load instead of 288!)
- ✅ Runs during low-traffic period
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ Predictable resource usage

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Entities not available in real-time
- ⚠️ Daily delay for new articles
- ⚠️ May not meet product requirements

## Recommendation

**Implement Option 1 + Option 3 as a two-phase approach:**

### Phase 1: Quick Win (Today - 15 minutes)

**Increase batch size from 100 to 500:**

```python
# orchestration/continuous_processor.py line 38
GAZETTEER_BATCH_SIZE = 500  # Was 100
```

**Expected impact:**
- 80% reduction in model reloads
- 80% reduction in memory spikes
- More stable memory usage

### Phase 2: Proper Fix (This Week - 2 hours)

**Refactor to direct function call:**

1. Modify `handle_entity_extraction_command` to accept optional extractor
2. Create global cached extractor in continuous_processor
3. Call function directly instead of subprocess

**Expected impact:**
- 100% elimination of model reloads
- Flat memory profile (2.5GB constant)
- 10 min/day saved in model loading time
- Better memory efficiency

# Deploy
# (rebuild and deploy processor image)
```

### This Week (2-3 hours)

**1. Refactor entity extraction command (1 hour)**

```python
# src/cli/commands/entity_extraction.py

def handle_entity_extraction_command(args, extractor=None) -> int:
    """Execute entity extraction with optional pre-loaded extractor."""
    limit = getattr(args, "limit", 100)
    source = getattr(args, "source", None)
    
    db = DatabaseManager()
    
    # Use provided extractor or create new one
    if extractor is None:
        extractor = ArticleEntityExtractor()
    
    # ... rest of logic unchanged
```

**2. Update continuous processor (1 hour)**

```python
# orchestration/continuous_processor.py

# Global cached extractor
_ENTITY_EXTRACTOR = None

def get_cached_entity_extractor():
    """Get or create cached entity extractor (model loaded once)."""
    global _ENTITY_EXTRACTOR
    if _ENTITY_EXTRACTOR is None:
        from src.pipeline.entity_extraction import ArticleEntityExtractor
        logger.info("🧠 Loading spaCy model (one-time initialization)...")
        _ENTITY_EXTRACTOR = ArticleEntityExtractor()
        logger.info("✅ spaCy model loaded and cached")
    return _ENTITY_EXTRACTOR

def process_entity_extraction(count: int) -> bool:
    """Run entity extraction using cached model."""
    if count == 0:
        return False

    limit = min(count, GAZETTEER_BATCH_SIZE)
    
    try:
        from argparse import Namespace
        from src.cli.commands.entity_extraction import handle_entity_extraction_command
        
        logger.info("▶️  Entity extraction (%d pending, limit %d)", count, limit)
        
        # Get cached extractor (model already loaded!)
        extractor = get_cached_entity_extractor()
        
        # Call directly instead of subprocess
        args = Namespace(limit=limit, source=None)
        result = handle_entity_extraction_command(args, extractor=extractor)
        
        if result == 0:
            logger.info("✅ Entity extraction completed")
            return True
        else:
            logger.error("❌ Entity extraction failed")
            return False
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Entity extraction error: %s", e)
        return False
```

**3. Test (30 minutes)**

```bash
# Run locally
python orchestration/continuous_processor.py

# Check logs for:
# - "Loading spaCy model" should appear ONCE at startup
# - Not on every batch
# - Memory should stay constant around 2.5GB
```

**4. Deploy (30 minutes)**

```bash
# Rebuild processor
gcloud builds triggers run build-processor-manual \
  --branch=feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment

# Monitor deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Watch memory
watch kubectl top pod -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
```

- [ ] Processor restarts reduced by 80%
- [ ] Memory spikes reduced by 80%

**After Phase 2:**

## Additional Optimizations (Future)

Once the model is cached properly, we can further optimize:

### 1. Use Smaller Model
```python
# Current: en_core_web_sm (43MB disk, 500MB+ in memory)
# Alternative: en_core_web_sm with disabled components

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm", disable=["parser", "lemmatizer"])
# Only keep: tokenizer + NER
# Reduces memory by ~30%
```

### 2. Batch Process Multiple Articles at Once
```python
# Instead of: for article in articles: nlp(article.text)
# Use: docs = nlp.pipe([a.text for a in articles], batch_size=50)
# spaCy can process batches more efficiently
```

### 3. Consider GPU Acceleration
```python
# For very high throughput, spaCy supports GPU
spacy.require_gpu()
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
# Can be 10x faster, but requires GPU nodes ($$)
```

---

**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Priority:** HIGH - Wastes 10min/day + causes memory pressure  
**Effort:** Phase 1 = 5min, Phase 2 = 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** 80-99% reduction in model reload waste
