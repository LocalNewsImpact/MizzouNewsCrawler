# Cleaning Status Update Fix

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Commit:** 545efcd  
**Branch:** feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment  
**Build:** f6581c71-4850-466b-8d8b-3b905699b239 (QUEUED)

## Problem Identified

### Root Cause Analysis

The cleaning command (`src/cli/commands/cleaning.py`) had a critical logic bug on line 149:

```python
# OLD CODE (BUGGY):
if cleaned_content != original_content:
    # Update database with new status
```

**The Issue:**
- Articles are selected with `WHERE status = 'extracted'`
- Cleaning processes the article through `BalancedBoundaryContentCleaner.process_single_article()`
- If cleaning detects the content is already clean (no changes needed):
  - `cleaned_content == original_content` → True
  - Database NOT updated
  - Status remains `extracted`
  - Article selected again in next cycle ♻️

**Result:** 1,442 articles stuck in infinite reprocessing loop because their content was already clean.

### Why Content Might Not Change

1. **Article already clean** - No boilerplate to remove
2. **Previous manual cleaning** - Content cleaned by publisher
3. **Simple article structure** - No patterns matching removal criteria
4. **High-quality source** - Publisher uses clean HTML

**Key Insight:** If an article goes through the cleaning process and no changes are needed, it has **still been cleaned** - the status should be `cleaned`, not left as `extracted`.

---

## The Fix

### Code Changes (545efcd)

```python
# NEW CODE (FIXED):
# Determine if we need to update the article
content_changed = cleaned_content != original_content
status_changed = new_status != current_status

# Update if content changed OR status changed
if content_changed or status_changed:
    # Update database with new status
    
    if content_changed:
        cleaned += 1
    if status_changed:
        status_changes[f"{current_status}→{new_status}"] += 1
```

### What Changed

**Before:**
- Only updated database when `content != original_content`
- Articles with already-clean content stayed `extracted`
- Reprocessed infinitely

**After:**
- Updates database when `content_changed OR status_changed`
- Even if content unchanged, status updates to `cleaned`
- Articles processed once and move forward

### Status Transition Logic

The fix ensures proper status transitions:

1. **Wire service detected:**
   - `extracted` → `wire`
   
2. **Local wire detected:**
   - `extracted` → `local`
   
3. **No wire detected:**
   - `extracted` → `cleaned`

These transitions happen **regardless of whether content changed**.

## Expected Impact

### Before Fix (b5166f8)

```
Content cleaning cycle at 20:57 UTC:
  Articles processed: 100
  Content cleaned: 1
  Errors: 0
  Status changes: extracted→cleaned: 1 article
```

**Analysis:**
- 100 articles processed
- Only 1 had content changes → database updated
- 99 stayed `extracted` → will be processed again
- **Infinite loop**

### After Fix (545efcd)

```
Expected content cleaning cycle:
  Articles processed: 100
  Content cleaned: 5-20 (estimated)
  Errors: 0
  Status changes: 
    extracted→cleaned: 85-95 articles
    extracted→wire: 5-10 articles
    extracted→local: 0-5 articles
```

**Analysis:**
- 100 articles processed
- 5-20 have content changes → `cleaned` counter increments
- ALL 100 get status updated → move out of `extracted`
- **Queue decreases**

gcloud builds list --limit=1

# Check deployment
kubectl get deployment -n production mizzou-processor -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'

# Monitor cleaning cycles
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor -f | grep -E "(Content cleaning|Articles processed|Status changes)"

# Check queue decrease
kubectl exec -n production deployment/mizzou-processor -- python3 -c "
from src.models.database import DatabaseManager
from sqlalchemy import text
db = DatabaseManager()
session = db.get_session().__enter__()
extracted = session.execute(text(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles WHERE status = 'extracted'\")).scalar()
print(f'Extraction queue: {extracted}')
"
```

## Expected Results

### Queue Clearance

**Current State:**
- Extraction queue: 1,442 articles
- All stuck being reprocessed

**After Fix:**
- Cycle 1 (15 min): 1,442 → 1,342 (100 processed)
- Cycle 2 (30 min): 1,342 → 1,242 (100 processed)
- Cycle 3 (45 min): 1,242 → 1,142 (100 processed)
- ...
- Cycle 15 (3.75 hours): Queue cleared

### Status Distribution Change

**Before Fix:**
```
extracted: 1,442 (stuck)
cleaned:   2,411 (stale)
wire:      241
obituary:  197
opinion:   104
```

**After Fix (3-4 hours):**
```
extracted: 0-50 (normal flow)
cleaned:   3,500-3,700 (↑ 1,200)
wire:      350-400 (↑ 150)
local:     30-50 (↑ 30)
obituary:  200
opinion:   110
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- ✅ **Queue decreases:** 1,442 → 0 over 3-4 hours
- ✅ **Status transitions:** 100 per cycle (not just 1)
- ✅ **No infinite loop:** Articles processed once only
- ✅ **Zero errors:** Error count stays at 0

### Secondary Metrics
- ✅ **ML labeling increases:** More cleaned articles to label
- ✅ **Content cleaned counter:** 5-20% of articles (not 1%)
- ✅ **Cycle duration:** Stays ~50-60 seconds
- ✅ **Database updates:** 100 per cycle (not 1)

## Related Fixes

This is the **third fix** in the cleaning pipeline:

1. **c933832:** Initial cleaning command deployment
   - Status: FAILED (SQLite error)
   
2. **b5166f8:** Fixed SQLite analyze_domain() bug
   - Status: WORKING but infinite loop
   
3. **545efcd:** Fixed status update logic (THIS FIX)
   - Status: DEPLOYING → should fully work

---

## Notes

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

- The cleaning command was just deployed (c933832)
- First fix (b5166f8) resolved immediate crash
- Logs showed "100 articles processed" which looked successful
- Didn't notice only 1 status change until analyzing queue
- Required understanding code logic vs just reading logs

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always check the code logic** - Don't troubleshoot from logs alone
2. **Monitor queue size** - Not just error counts
3. **Distinguish metrics** - "processed" vs "content changed" vs "status changed"
4. **Status transitions matter** - Articles must move through pipeline
5. **Idempotency is critical** - Re-processing must be safe
