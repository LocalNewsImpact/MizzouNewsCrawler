# PR #75 Production Deployment Complete ✅

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Build ID:** 82809b39-fd0a-4a3b-b8d2-9fa289644872  
**Image Tag:** processor:f337d2c  
**Status:** DEPLOYED & VERIFIED

## Deployment Summary

Successfully built and deployed the processor image with PR #75 (Smart Single-Domain Detection) to production. The single-domain detection feature is now live and ready to improve rate limiting for datasets like Lehigh Valley.

## Build Details

**Trigger:** build-processor-manual  
**Branch:** feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment  
**Commit:** f337d2c (includes PR #75 merge)  
**Build Time:** ~4 minutes  
**Result:** SUCCESS

### Build Steps Completed

1. ✅ **warm-cache** - Pulled previous processor image for layer caching
2. ✅ **build-processor** - Built new processor with PR #75 changes using ml-base:latest
3. ✅ **push-processor** - Pushed processor:f337d2c to Artifact Registry
4. ✅ **resolve-current-tags** - Resolved API and crawler image tags for release
5. ✅ **create-release** - Created Cloud Deploy release "processor-f337d2c"
6. ✅ **get-gke-credentials** - Connected to mizzou-cluster
7. ✅ **force-processor-update** - Updated deployment to use new image

## Deployment Verification

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment mizzou-processor -n production -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mizzou-news-crawler/mizzou-crawler/processor:f337d2c ✅

$ kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mizzou-processor-5ccfbf448b-bl75m   1/1     Running   0          5m
```

**Processor Status:** Running with new image containing PR #75 changes

## Test Execution

Launched a test Lehigh extraction job to verify deployment:

```bash
$ python3 scripts/launch_dataset_job.py \
    --dataset "Penn-State-Lehigh" \
    --batches 2 \
    --limit 10

✅ Job completed successfully
```

**Result:** Job ran and completed quickly - no new articles to extract, which is expected behavior. The deployment is working correctly.

## What's Now Live in Production

### 1. Proactive Domain Analysis
Before extraction starts, the system will:
- Sample up to 1,000 candidate URLs from the dataset
- Count unique domains across the sample
- Determine if the dataset is single-domain (≤1 unique domain)
- Log the analysis results

### 2. Smart Rate Limiting
Enhanced batch sleep logic that automatically applies conservative rate limiting for single-domain datasets:

```python
needs_long_pause = (
    is_single_domain_dataset or      # NEW: Proactive detection
    same_domain_consecutive >= 3 or   # Fallback: reactive
    unique_domains <= 1               # Fallback: per-batch
)
```

### 3. Clear Logging
When a single-domain dataset is detected, operators will see:

```
📊 Dataset analysis: 1 unique domain(s)
⚠️  Single-domain dataset detected: lehighvalleynews.com
🐌 Rate limiting will be conservative to avoid bot detection
```

And during processing:

```
📄 Processing batch 1 (10 articles)...
✓ Batch 1 complete: 10 articles extracted (440 remaining)
   ⏸️  Single-domain dataset - waiting 420s...
```

## Benefits Now Active

### For Lehigh Valley Dataset
- ✅ Automatic detection when extraction jobs run
- ✅ Conservative 420-second pauses between batches
- ✅ Clear visibility into why delays are happening
- ✅ Reduced risk of 429 errors and IP blocks

### For All Datasets
- ✅ No configuration changes needed - detection is automatic
- ✅ Multi-domain datasets continue to use faster rotation strategy
- ✅ Improved troubleshooting with explicit reasoning in logs
- ✅ Cost savings from fewer failed extraction attempts

## Next Extraction Runs

When the next Lehigh extraction job runs (either via CronJob or manual launch), you should see the new logging output showing domain analysis and single-domain detection.

**To trigger a test run with articles:**

```bash
# Wait for new articles to be discovered in candidate_links
# Or manually trigger discovery first:
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mizzou-crawler mizzou-crawler-manual -n production

# Then launch extraction job
python3 scripts/launch_dataset_job.py \
  --dataset "Penn-State-Lehigh" \
  --batches 3 \
  --limit 20
```

## Image Tags Deployed

- **Processor:** us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mizzou-news-crawler/mizzou-crawler/processor:f337d2c
- **Also tagged as:** processor:v1.3.1, processor:latest
- **Contains:**
  - PR #76: Phases 1-5 Foundation (database engine, telemetry)
  - PR #75: Smart Single-Domain Detection (rate limiting improvements)
  - All infrastructure fixes from earlier commits

## Documentation Available

All PR #75 documentation is now accessible in the repository:

- **Quick Reference:** `docs/SINGLE_DOMAIN_QUICKREF.md`
- **Implementation Details:** `ISSUE_74_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Completion Summary:** `ISSUE_74_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- **Troubleshooting:** `k8s/templates/README.md` (updated)

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise, you can roll back to the previous processor image:

```bash
# Find previous working image tag
kubectl rollout history deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Rollback to previous revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Or set specific image
kubectl set image deployment/mizzou-processor \
  processor=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mizzou-news-crawler/mizzou-crawler/processor:396fa0f \
  -n production
```

## Monitoring

Watch for these indicators of successful deployment:

1. **Single-domain detection logging** in extraction job logs
2. **Longer pauses** (420s) between batches for Lehigh jobs
3. **Reduced 429 errors** for Lehigh Valley source
4. **Successful extractions** without IP blocks

```bash
# Monitor Lehigh extraction jobs
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Penn-State-Lehigh --follow

# Check processor health
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=100
```
