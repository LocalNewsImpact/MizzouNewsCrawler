## Critical Fixes Included

### 1. Selenium Fallback Fix (Commit d868b99)
**Problem:** Selenium blocked by rate limit check after CAPTCHA detection  
**Impact:** 0% extraction success rate, Selenium never running

**Fix:**
- Removed rate limit check from Selenium fallback
- Added separate `_selenium_failure_counts` tracking
- Selenium now bypasses rate limits (CAPTCHA bypass tool)
- Only skipped after 3 consecutive Selenium failures

**Result:** Selenium attempting extractions (was 0 attempts)

### 2. Entity Extraction Sentinel Fix (Commit df12220)
**Problem:** Articles with 0 entities infinitely reprocessed  
**Impact:** 1,815 articles stuck, same 50 reprocessed every cycle

**Fix:**
- Add sentinel entity when extraction finds nothing
- Entity text: `__NO_ENTITIES_FOUND__`
- Entity label: `SENTINEL`
- Prevents matching `NOT EXISTS` query

**Result:** Queue decreasing (1,815 ‚Üí ~1,600), 812 entities extracted

### 3. Standalone Cleaning Command (Commits c933832, b5166f8)
**Problem:** 1,439 articles stuck at "extracted" status  
**Impact:** Pipeline stalled since October 2, 2025

**Root Cause:** Cleaning only ran during extraction for successfully extracted articles. With 0 successful extractions, no cleaning happened.

**Fix:**
- Created `clean-articles` command
- Queries articles with status="extracted"
- Runs BalancedBoundaryContentCleaner
- Updates status: extracted ‚Üí cleaned/wire/local
- Integrated into continuous processor
- Fixed SQLite connection issue (b5166f8)

**Result:** Backlog can now progress independently of extraction

### 4. ML Labeling Status Fix
**Problem:** ML labeling only looking for "cleaned"/"local" status  
**Impact:** 0 articles labeled despite 1,787 pending

**Fix:**
- Added `--status extracted` to analysis command
- Can now label both extracted and cleaned articles

**Result:** ML labeling will process 1,439+ articles

## Deployment Status

### Already Deployed (Production)
‚úÖ **Bot blocking improvements** (5f8ff4b) - Deployed Oct 10, 15:56 UTC  
‚úÖ **Selenium fallback fix** (d868b99) - Deployed Oct 10, 16:26 UTC  
‚úÖ **Entity extraction sentinels** (df12220) - Deployed Oct 10, 17:41 UTC  

### Currently Deploying
üöß **Cleaning command fix** (b5166f8) - Building now (Build ID: e1e2ab51)  
‚è≥ Expected completion: 20:00 UTC

### Production Results So Far
- ‚úÖ Entity extraction working (queue 1,815 ‚Üí ~1,600)
- ‚úÖ Selenium attempting (15+ tries, was 0)
- ‚úÖ Bot protection detection working (CAPTCHA backoffs applied)
- ‚è≥ Cleaning starting soon (1,321 pending)
- ‚è≥ Still 0% extraction success (sites still blocking despite improvements)

---

## Pipeline Recovery Status

### Before Fixes (Oct 2-10)
- Last successful full pipeline: **October 2, 2025 6:00 PM**
- Articles stuck: **1,439 at "extracted"**
- Entity extraction: **Infinite loop (1,815 stuck)**
- Cleaning: **Not running (0 cleaned)**
- ML labeling: **Not running (0 labels)**
- Extraction success: **0%**

### After Fixes (Expected within 24 hours)
- Entity extraction: **Working** (queue decreasing)
- Cleaning: **Running** (100 articles per 14 minutes)
- ML labeling: **Running** (processing extracted + cleaned)
- Extraction success: **Still 0%** (bot blocking persists)
- Pipeline: **Partially unblocked** (can process backlog)

### Remaining Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **Extraction still failing** - All sites still bot-blocking despite:
- Modern User-Agents (Chrome 127-129, Firefox 130-131)
- Realistic HTTP headers
- Bot protection detection
- Selenium attempting extraction

**Root cause:** Sites using advanced protection:
- PerimeterX (px-captcha) - requires JavaScript execution
- Cloudflare - JavaScript challenges
- Advanced fingerprinting - detects lack of real browser

**Next steps:**
- Monitor cleaning success after b5166f8 deploys
- Consider IP rotation (residential proxies)
- Evaluate CAPTCHA solving services for high-value articles
- Implement domain-specific extraction strategies

## Conclusion

Successfully merged all critical fixes into feature branch. The merge brings:

1. **Selenium fallback fix** - Unblocks CAPTCHA bypass tool
2. **Entity extraction fix** - Stops infinite loop
3. **Standalone cleaning** - Unblocks 1,439 article backlog
4. **ML labeling fix** - Processes extracted articles

**Impact:** Pipeline can now process backlog independently of extraction success. While extraction is still 0% due to persistent bot blocking, the cleaning command breaks the dependency and allows downstream stages (entity extraction, ML labeling) to complete.

**Branch Status:** feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment ready for further work or merge to main once cleaning is verified working in production.
