   - Troubleshooting tips

5. **ISSUE_74_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (NEW, 326 lines)
   - Technical implementation details
   - Configuration guidelines
   - Architecture decisions

6. **ISSUE_74_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** (NEW, 385 lines)
   - Complete implementation summary
   - Success metrics
   - Testing results

## Key Features

### 1. Proactive Domain Analysis

Before extraction starts, the system now:
- Samples up to 1,000 candidate URLs
- Identifies unique domains
- Determines if dataset is single-domain
- Logs analysis results for operator visibility

```python
# Example output
{
    "unique_domains": 1,
    "is_single_domain": True,
    "sample_domains": ["lehighvalleynews.com"]
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting Logic

```python
# Priority-based detection
needs_long_pause = (
    is_single_domain_dataset or      # NEW: Proactive detection
    same_domain_consecutive >= 3 or   # Fallback: reactive per-batch
    unique_domains <= 1               # Fallback: batch analysis
)
```

### 3. Clear Operator Feedback

```
📊 Dataset analysis: 1 unique domain(s)
⚠️  Single-domain dataset detected: lehighvalleynews.com
🐌 Rate limiting will be conservative to avoid bot detection

📄 Processing batch 1 (3 articles)...
✓ Batch 1 complete: 3 articles extracted (447 remaining)
   ⏸️  Single-domain dataset - waiting 420s...
```

## Benefits

### For Lehigh Valley Dataset
- ✅ Automatic detection of single domain (lehighvalleynews.com)
- ✅ Conservative rate limiting applied automatically
- ✅ Clear logging of why rate limiting is being applied
- ✅ No configuration changes needed to existing job YAML

### For All Datasets
- ✅ Reduced operator configuration burden
- ✅ Proactive prevention of rate limit errors
- ✅ Better troubleshooting with explicit reasoning
- ✅ Scales automatically to any dataset

### Cost Efficiency
- ✅ Fewer 429 rate limit errors = less wasted compute time
- ✅ Better resource utilization through appropriate timing
- ✅ Reduced need for manual intervention and job restarts

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing extraction jobs continue to work unchanged. The system automatically detects domain diversity and applies appropriate rate limiting without requiring any YAML modifications.

## Testing Status

**Unit Tests:** Cannot verify locally (missing `fastapi` dependency in test environment)  
**Code Review:** ✅ Verified merge successful, all files present  
**Production Testing:** Ready for deployment

### Recommended Production Test

Deploy the processor with PR #75 changes and run a small Lehigh extraction job:

```bash
# Build new processor image with PR #75
gcloud builds triggers run build-processor-manual --branch=feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment

# Launch test extraction job
kubectl delete job extract-penn-state-lehigh -n production
python3 scripts/launch_dataset_job.py \
  --dataset Penn-State-Lehigh \
  --batches 1 \
  --limit 20 \
  --cpu-request 100m \
  --cpu-limit 500m \
  --memory-request 512Mi \
  --memory-limit 2Gi

# Monitor logs for domain analysis
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Penn-State-Lehigh --follow
```

**Expected Output:**
```
📊 Dataset analysis: 1 unique domain(s)
⚠️  Single-domain dataset detected: lehighvalleynews.com
🐌 Rate limiting will be conservative to avoid bot detection
```

## Conflict Resolution

The merge required resolving conflicts in `src/cli/commands/extraction.py`:
- **Conflict:** Both PR #76 (telemetry) and PR #75 (domain detection) modified the extraction function
- **Resolution:** Accepted incoming changes from PR #75, which included the domain analysis logic
- **Result:** Clean merge preserving both telemetry and domain detection features

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production** - Build processor image with these changes
2. **Test with Lehigh Job** - Verify domain detection works in production
3. **Monitor Performance** - Watch for improved rate limit handling
4. **Mark PR #75 as Complete** - Close the GitHub PR
