# Phase 1 Deployment - Executive Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Prepared For**: PR #78 Rollout  
**Status**: ✅ Ready to Execute

---

## 📋 What You're Deploying

### The Change
PR #78 refactors the continuous processor to use feature flags that disable external pipeline steps (discovery, verification, extraction). The processor will continue handling internal processing only (cleaning, ML analysis, entity extraction).

### Why It's Safe
- **Non-breaking**: Existing articles continue processing
- **Reversible**: Simple rollback via `kubectl rollout undo`
- **Tested**: 32 tests passing ✅
- **Gradual**: Phase 1 is only 2 days, Phase 2 restores extraction

### The Trade-Off
- **⚠️ No new articles** will be discovered/extracted during Phase 1 (2 days)
- **✅ Existing articles** continue processing normally
- **✅ No data loss** - all tables unchanged

---

## 🎯 Changes, Risks & Validation

### What Changes

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Discovery** | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled |
| **Verification** | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled |
| **Extraction** | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled |
| **Cleaning** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled |
| **ML Analysis** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled |
| **Entity Extraction** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled |

**Result**: Processor becomes a "pure processing engine" - no external HTTP requests, no rate limiting concerns.

### Risks & Mitigation

#### 🟡 Medium: No New Articles (2 Days)
**Impact**: Pipeline won't discover new content  
**Mitigation**: Short duration, Phase 2 restores extraction immediately  
**Detection**: `candidate_links` count stays stable  
**Acceptable**: Yes - 2 days is acceptable gap

#### 🔴 High: Processor Fails to Start
**Impact**: All processing stops  
**Mitigation**: 32 tests passing, liveness probes detect failures  
**Rollback**: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/mizzou-processor -n production`  
**Time to Recover**: <5 minutes

#### 🟢 Low: Feature Flag Misconfiguration
**Impact**: Wrong steps enabled/disabled  
**Detection**: Check logs for "Enabled pipeline steps" message  
**Fix**: Update deployment YAML, reapply  
**Time to Fix**: <10 minutes

### Validation Tests Required

Before proceeding to Phase 2, **all 5 tests must pass**:

1. **✅ Processor Health**: Pod running, 0 restarts, healthy probes
2. **✅ Feature Flags**: External steps disabled (❌), internal steps enabled (✅)
3. **✅ Processing Continues**: Cleaning/ML/entity queues decreasing
4. **✅ No New Extractions**: 0 new articles in `extracted` status (expected)
5. **✅ System Stability**: <10 errors/2 hours, resource usage stable

**Validation Period**: 24 hours of monitoring

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Execute automated deployment script
./scripts/deploy_phase1.sh
```

The script handles:
- ✅ Baseline metrics prompting
- ✅ PR merge with conflict detection
- ✅ Test execution (32 tests)
- ✅ Cloud Build trigger
- ✅ Image verification
- ✅ Deployment with rollout monitoring
- ✅ Feature flag validation

**Duration**: ~10-15 minutes

### Manual Steps

See `PHASE1_DEPLOYMENT_TRACKER.md` for detailed step-by-step guide.

## 📊 Monitoring Checklist

### Day 1 (Deployment Day - Today)
- [ ] **Pre-deployment**: Record baseline metrics (article counts, extraction rates)
- [ ] **Deployment**: Execute `./scripts/deploy_phase1.sh`
- [ ] **Immediate**: Verify feature flags in logs (5 min)
- [ ] **Short-term**: Monitor processor logs (1 hour)
- [ ] **End of day**: Confirm 0 new extractions, processing continues

### Day 2 (Validation Day - Tomorrow)
- [ ] **Morning**: Check pod health (0 restarts)
- [ ] **Midday**: Run database validation queries
- [ ] **Afternoon**: Test all 5 validation criteria
- [ ] **Evening**: Complete Phase 1 report
- [ ] **Decision**: GO/NO-GO for Phase 2

### Key Metrics to Watch

```bash
# Processor health
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

# Real-time logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --follow

# Error rate
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --since=2h | grep -i "error" | wc -l

# Resource usage
kubectl top pod -n production -l app=mizzou-processor
```

```sql
-- Processing queues (should decrease)
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'extracted' THEN 1 END) as cleaning_pending,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'cleaned' AND primary_label IS NULL THEN 1 END) as analysis_pending
FROM articles;

-- New extractions (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) as new_extractions
FROM articles
WHERE status = 'extracted' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours';
```

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if deployment fails)

```bash
# Revert to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/mizzou-processor -n production
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=50
```

**Time to Execute**: <2 minutes  
**Data Loss**: None  
**Recovery**: Immediate (processor resumes all steps)

### Partial Rollback (if only feature flags wrong)

```bash
# Re-enable extraction
kubectl set env deployment/mizzou-processor -n production \
  ENABLE_EXTRACTION=true \
  ENABLE_DISCOVERY=true \
  ENABLE_VERIFICATION=true
```

**Time to Execute**: <1 minute  
**Data Loss**: None  
**Recovery**: Immediate

## ✅ Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### GO to Phase 2 (All Must Pass)
- [x] Processor deployed successfully
- [x] Pod running 24+ hours with 0 restarts
- [x] Feature flags correct (external ❌, internal ✅)
- [x] Processing continues (queues decreasing)
- [x] No new extractions (as expected)
- [x] Error rate <10 per 2 hours
- [x] No database connection issues
- [x] Resource usage stable (CPU, memory within 50% of baseline)

### NO-GO (Any Fail)
**Action**: Investigate issue, fix, retry Phase 1 or rollback

### Decision Point
**When**: End of Day 2 (October 16, 2025)  
**Who**: Project lead + team consensus  
**Documentation**: Complete Phase 1 report in `PHASE1_DEPLOYMENT_TRACKER.md`

2. **Execute deployment**: `./scripts/deploy_phase1.sh`
3. **Monitor 24 hours**: Follow monitoring checklist
4. **Validate**: Run all 5 tests
5. **Decide**: GO/NO-GO for Phase 2

**Expected Outcome**: Safe, non-breaking deployment with processor focusing solely on internal processing. External steps (discovery/extraction) will be restored in Phase 2 via dataset-specific jobs.
