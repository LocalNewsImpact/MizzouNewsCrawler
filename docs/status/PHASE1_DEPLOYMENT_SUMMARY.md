## Deployment Steps Executed

### 1. Modified PR #78 Branch (Backward Compatibility)

```bash
git checkout copilot/refactor-pipeline-orchestration

# Modified k8s/processor-deployment.yaml
# Changed ENABLE_DISCOVERY from "false" to "true"
# Changed ENABLE_VERIFICATION from "false" to "true"
# Changed ENABLE_EXTRACTION from "true" to "true"

git commit -m "Phase 1: Keep all pipeline steps enabled for backward compatibility"
git push origin copilot/refactor-pipeline-orchestration
```

**Commit**: `9c8b85e`

### 2. Ran Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_continuous_processor.py -v
```

**Result**: ✅ All 32 tests passed  
**Coverage**: 11.71% (expected - only continuous_processor.py fully tested)

### 3. Merged to Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment
git merge copilot/refactor-pipeline-orchestration --no-edit
```

**Result**: Clean merge, no conflicts  
**Files changed**: 11 files (+1,426 lines, -52 lines)

### 4. Built Processor Image

```bash
gcloud builds triggers run build-processor-manual \
  --branch=feature/gcp-kubernetes-deployment \
  --project=mizzou-news-crawler
```

**Build ID**: `ae3ab144-a440-4bcf-98e8-da39048cdf94`

**Tags**: `df9f975`, `latest`, `v1.3.1`

### 5. Deployed to Production

```bash
# Automatic deployment via Cloud Build
kubectl rollout status deployment/mizzou-processor -n production
```

**Result**: Deployment rolled out successfully  
**Pod restart**: New pod started at 15:00:53 UTC

### 6. Applied Updated Deployment Manifest

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/processor-deployment.yaml
```

**Result**: Feature flag environment variables added to running pod

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Feature Flags Verified

```bash
$ kubectl exec -n production deployment/mizzou-processor -- env | grep "ENABLE_"

ENABLE_ML_ANALYSIS=true
ENABLE_EXTRACTION=true
ENABLE_CLEANING=true
ENABLE_DISCOVERY=true
ENABLE_VERIFICATION=true
ENABLE_ENTITY_EXTRACTION=true
```

✅ **All flags set to TRUE as planned** (backward compatible mode)

### Extraction Confirmed Running

Processor logs show active extraction at 15:03:32:

```
2025-10-15 15:03:32,233 [INFO] Successfully extracted all fields for 
https://www.newspressnow.com/ap/ap-world-news/2025/10/15/afghanistan-says...

2025-10-15 15:04:20,199 [INFO] Successfully extracted all fields for 
https://www.newspressnow.com/ap/ap-sports/2025/10/14/sports-betting...

2025-10-15 15:05:45,064 [INFO] Successfully extracted all fields for 
https://www.newspressnow.com/stacker-money/2025/10/14/14-cities...
```

✅ **Extraction continues normally** (no disruption)

### Work Queue Status

At 15:00:55 UTC (immediately after deployment):

```
Work queue status: {
  'verification_pending': 0,
  'extraction_pending': 118,
  'cleaning_pending': 7,
  'analysis_pending': 606,
  'entity_extraction_pending': 16
}
```

✅ **Queue depths look healthy**

### Pod Health

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mizzou-processor-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX   1/1     Running   0          10m
```

✅ **Pod running, no restarts**

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Feature Flag Logging Not Appearing

**Expected logs**:
```
Enabled pipeline steps:
  - Discovery: ✅
  - Verification: ✅
  - Extraction: ✅
  ...
```

**Actual**: These log lines don't appear in processor startup logs

**Impact**: **COSMETIC ONLY** - flags are correctly set (verified via `env`), just not logged

**Root cause**: Code exists in `orchestration/continuous_processor.py` lines 344-351 but not executing or output suppressed

**Action**: Investigate in Phase 2 (non-blocking for Phase 1)

---

## 24-Hour Monitoring Plan

### Metrics to Track

1. **Extraction rate**: Compare tomorrow to baseline (198 articles/24h)
2. **Queue depths**: Should remain near 0 for cleaning/analysis
3. **Pod stability**: Check restart count (should be 0)
4. **Error rate**: Check logs for exceptions
5. **Resource usage**: CPU and memory should be stable

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check pod health
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

# View recent logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=200

# Check for errors
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=500 | grep -i error

# Get current metrics (run tomorrow at same time)
kubectl exec -n production deployment/mizzou-processor -- python -c "
from src.models.database import DatabaseManager
from sqlalchemy import text
db = DatabaseManager()
with db.get_session() as session:
    result = session.execute(text('SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM articles GROUP BY status ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC'))
    print('Article counts:')
    for row in result:
        print(f'  {row[0]}: {row[1]}')
    
    result = session.execute(text(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'\"))
    print(f'New articles (24h): {result.scalar()}')
"
```

### Success Criteria (24 Hours)

- ✅ **Extraction continues**: New articles added at normal rate (~200/day)
- ✅ **No crashes**: Pod restart count = 0
- ✅ **Low error rate**: <10 errors per 2 hours
- ✅ **Stable resources**: CPU/memory within normal ranges
- ✅ **Queue processing**: Cleaning and analysis queues stay near 0

---

## Phase 1 GO/NO-GO Decision

**When**: October 16, 2025 evening (after 24h monitoring)

**GO Criteria** (proceed to Phase 2):
- All 5 success criteria met
- Extraction rate comparable to baseline
- No unexpected errors
- System stable

**Phase 2 Plan** (if GO):
- Deploy `k8s/mizzou-extraction-job.yaml`
- Run Mizzou extraction job **in parallel** with processor
- Monitor for conflicts (both trying to extract same articles)
- Verify independent rate limiting works
- Duration: 48 hours parallel operation

**NO-GO Actions** (if issues):
- Investigate errors in logs
- Review resource constraints
- Check for race conditions
- Fix identified issues
- Retry Phase 1 deployment

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

### Immediate Rollback (< 2 minutes)

```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/mizzou-processor -n production

# Check old image is running
kubectl get deployment mizzou-processor -n production \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
# Should show: processor:d0c043e (previous image)
```

### Verify Rollback

```bash
# Extraction should continue
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=100 | grep extraction

# Feature flags should be gone (old code doesn't have them)
kubectl exec -n production deployment/mizzou-processor -- env | grep "ENABLE_"
# Should return nothing
```
