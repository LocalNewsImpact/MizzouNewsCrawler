# Copilot Instructions for MizzouNewsCrawler

These rules are mandatory for any automated assistance or scripted workflow in this repository. Treat them as blockersâ€”never proceed to deployment steps until each applicable check is satisfied.

1. **Always inspect database schema before running Cloud SQL queries.**
   - **NEVER** assume column names or table structures exist without verification.
   - Use SQLAlchemy's `inspect()` to get actual table schemas: `inspector.get_columns('table_name')`
   - Check if tables exist first: `'table_name' in inspector.get_table_names()`
   - Common mistakes to avoid:
     - Using `type`, `state`, `county` columns that don't exist in `gazetteer` table
     - Assuming `updated_at` exists (use `created_at` instead)
     - Assuming `news_sources` table exists (use proper table name)
     - Assuming foreign key columns exist without checking schema
   - **This prevents database errors and wasted query attempts.**

1. **Run pre-deployment validation before ANY deploy.**
   - **ALWAYS** run `./scripts/pre-deploy-validation.sh [service]` before triggering any deployment.
   - This validates: tests pass, YAML config is correct, changes are committed/pushed.
   - If validation fails, fix the issues before deploying.
   - **This would have prevented the PYTHONPATH bug and hours of wasted time.**

1. **Commit & push before deploy suggestions.**
   - Always inspect `git status`.
   - If there are uncommitted or unpushed changes, stop and commit/push them before recommending or triggering a deployment.
   - Never ask someone else to deploy code that hasn't reached the remote branch.

1. **Use Cloud Build/Deploy triggers for releases.**
   - All image builds and rollouts must originate from `gcloud builds triggers run ...` and the associated Cloud Deploy pipeline.
   - Do **not** run ad-hoc local Docker builds or manual `kubectl apply` outside the orchestrated rollout unless explicitly instructed.

1. **Guard test coverage for new code.**
   - For every change, ensure there is automated test coverage. Write or update unit/integration tests as part of the change.
   - Run the relevant test suites before recommending a deployment. Capture the command and result.
   - **Write integration tests that simulate the deployment environment** (e.g., PYTHONPATH, container structure).

1. **Surface coverage gaps proactively.**
   - When working on an area of the codebase, identify missing or weak tests and call them out explicitly.
   - Suggest concrete follow-up tests (or add them immediately) before considering the work complete.
   - **Test deployment configuration, not just application code.**

Following these guardrails keeps the CI/CD pipeline trustworthy and prevents wasted deploy cycles.
