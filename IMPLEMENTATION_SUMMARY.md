# Extraction Workflow Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issue #105: Extraction runs but articles not being written for 48+ hours

This document summarizes the complete implementation of fixes for the extraction workflow failure.

## Problem Statement

The extraction workflow was running successfully (no errors in logs) but articles were not being persisted to the database for 48+ hours. Key symptoms:

1. Extraction query reported "0 candidate articles" despite thousands existing with `status='article'`
2. No errors in extraction logs
3. Articles not appearing in database after commits
4. Possibility of silent commit failures (Cloud SQL connector bug)

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Silent Commit Failures**: Database commits appeared successful but data wasn't persisted
2. **Database Connection Ambiguity**: Unclear which database extractor was connecting to
3. **No Duplicate Prevention**: Missing UNIQUE constraint allowed duplicates at DB level
4. **Insufficient Debugging**: No way to dump exact SQL queries for reproduction

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Post-Commit Verification ✅

**File**: `src/cli/commands/extraction.py`

Added verification query after each article insert:

```python
# After session.commit()
verify_query = text("SELECT id FROM articles WHERE id = :id")
verify_result = session.execute(verify_query, {"id": article_id}).fetchone()

if verify_result is None:
    logger.error(
        "❌ POST-COMMIT VERIFICATION FAILED: Article %s was not found "
        "in database after commit. This indicates a silent commit failure!",
        article_id
    )
```

**Impact**: Immediately detects silent commit failures with clear error messages.

### 2. SQL Query Debugging ✅

**File**: `src/cli/commands/extraction.py`

Added `EXTRACTION_DUMP_SQL` environment variable:

```bash
export EXTRACTION_DUMP_SQL=true
python -m src.cli.cli_modular extract --limit 20
```

Logs the exact SQL query and parameters before execution for debugging.

### 3. Database Connection Logging ✅

**File**: `src/models/database.py`

Added initialization logging with password masking:

```python
@staticmethod
def _mask_password_in_url(database_url: str) -> str:
    """Mask password in database URL for safe logging."""
    # Handles edge cases like passwords containing @ symbols
    # Returns: postgresql://user:***@host/db
```

**Impact**: Shows which database is being used while keeping credentials secure.

### 4. Database Deduplication & Unique Constraint ✅

**File**: `alembic/versions/1a2b3c4d5e6f_add_unique_constraint_articles_url.py`

Migration that:
1. Deduplicates existing articles by URL (keeps oldest)
2. Adds UNIQUE constraint on `articles.url`
3. Uses `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for PostgreSQL (no locks)

**Impact**: Prevents duplicate articles at database level.

### 5. Integration Tests ✅

**File**: `tests/integration/test_extraction_db.py`

Tests:
- Article insertion and verification
- Extraction query logic
- ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING behavior
- Post-commit verification
- Candidate status updates

### 6. Security Hardening ✅

**Files**: `src/models/database.py`, `src/cli/commands/extraction.py`

Fixed CodeQL security alerts:
- Proper password masking in all database URL logs
- Handles edge cases (passwords with special characters)
- Comprehensive test coverage for masking logic

## Files Changed

1. **src/cli/commands/extraction.py**
   - Added post-commit verification
   - Added EXTRACTION_DUMP_SQL flag support
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Fixed password logging security issue

2. **src/models/database.py**

   - Migration to deduplicate articles
   - Add UNIQUE constraint on articles.url
   - PostgreSQL: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
   - SQLite: batch mode with deduplication

4. **tests/integration/test_extraction_db.py**
   - Comprehensive extraction database tests
   - 7 integration tests covering key scenarios

5. **scripts/test_extraction_fixes.py**
   - Smoke test suite
   - 6 tests validating all fixes

- ✓ Post-commit verification code is present
- ✓ Migration file is valid
- ✓ Integration tests exist

### Password Masking Tests ✅
All 5 edge cases passing:
- ✓ Normal password masking
- ✓ No password in URL
- ✓ SQLite paths (no masking needed)
- ✓ Passwords containing @ symbol
- ✓ Multiple @ symbols in password

### Code Quality ✅

- Security scan: PASSWORD MASKING IMPLEMENTED

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
# In production environment
alembic upgrade head
```

This will:
- Deduplicate existing articles (keeps oldest by created_at)
- Add UNIQUE constraint on articles.url
- Use CONCURRENTLY for PostgreSQL (no table locks)

### 2. Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `USE_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTOR=false` (until connector bug resolved)

**Optional (debugging):**
- `EXTRACTION_DUMP_SQL=true` (only for debugging, disable in production)

### 3. Monitoring

Watch for these log messages:

**Success indicators:**
```
INFO DatabaseManager initialized with URL: postgresql://user:***@host/db
INFO Using direct PostgreSQL connection
✓ Post-commit verification passed for article {id}
```

**Failure indicators:**
```
❌ POST-COMMIT VERIFICATION FAILED
⚠️  No articles found matching extraction criteria
Database URL being used: sqlite:///... (when expecting PostgreSQL)
```

### 4. Verification

After deployment, run:

```sql
-- Check recent extractions
SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(extracted_at)
FROM articles
WHERE extracted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Verify no duplicates
SELECT url, COUNT(*) as count
FROM articles
GROUP BY url
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Cloud SQL Connector Bug
- **Issue**: Async/await bug causes silent commit failures
- **Mitigation**: Set `USE_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTOR=false`
- **Alternative**: Use cloud-sql-proxy sidecar

### Post-Commit Verification Performance
- **Impact**: One extra SELECT query per article insert
- **Mitigation**: Minimal overhead (~1-5ms per article)
- **Future**: Could batch verify at end of batch instead

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise after migration:

```bash
# Rollback migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Disable post-commit verification
# (Edit extraction.py and comment out verification block)

# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Verification**: Verify multiple articles at once instead of one-by-one
2. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed verifications
3. **Metrics**: Add Prometheus metrics for verification failures
4. **Alerting**: Alert when verification failures exceed threshold
5. **ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE**: Update existing articles instead of skipping

## Success Criteria

✅ Post-commit verification catches silent failures
✅ EXTRACTION_DUMP_SQL flag enables debugging
✅ Database URL logging shows connection details (passwords masked)
✅ UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicates
✅ Migration runs without downtime (CONCURRENTLY)
✅ All tests pass
✅ Security vulnerabilities fixed
✅ Documentation complete

# Implementation Summary: Article URL Deduplication

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive solution for GitHub Issue #105 to enforce article URL deduplication at the database level.

## Implementation Date

2025-10-25

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (`alembic/versions/20251025_add_unique_articles_url.py`)

- Creates unique index `uq_articles_url` on `articles.url` column
- Uses `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for PostgreSQL (non-blocking)
- Includes pre-flight duplicate detection that fails migration if duplicates exist
- Supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Fully tested upgrade and downgrade paths

**Key Features:**
- Non-blocking for production deployments
- Safety check prevents corruption
- Clear error messages guide manual remediation

### 2. Deduplication Script (`scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py`)

Enhanced existing script with:
- Comprehensive logging via Python logging module
- Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) for safe analysis
- Interactive confirmation prompts
- Command-line arguments (`--yes`, `--create-index`)
- Support for both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Idempotent operation (safe to re-run)

**Deduplication Policy:**
- Keeps: Most recent article (by `extracted_at` timestamp)
- Deletes: Older duplicates and their child records

### 3. Test Suite (`tests/alembic/test_articles_url_constraint.py`)

Comprehensive integration tests covering:
- Migration success on clean database
- Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- Migration fails when duplicates exist (safety check)
- ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING works correctly
- Deduplication script dry-run mode
- Proper rollback via downgrade

**Test Statistics:**
- 6 test cases
- Both positive and negative scenarios
- Integration tests with real SQLite database

### 4. Documentation (`docs/migrations/articles_url_deduplication.md`)

Complete production runbook including:
- Pre-migration requirements
- Step-by-step deployment procedure
- Verification steps
- Monitoring guidance
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Rollback procedures

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing ✅

All manual tests passed:

1. **Migration Success**
   ```bash
   ✓ alembic upgrade head
   ✓ Index created: uq_articles_url
   ```

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   ```bash
   ✓ ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING silently ignores duplicates
   ✓ Only first article retained
   ```

3. **Safety Check**
   ```bash
   ✓ Migration fails with duplicates
   ✓ Clear error message provided
   ```

4. **Rollback**
   ```bash
   ✓ alembic downgrade removes index
   ✓ No data loss during rollback
   ```

### Code Quality ✅

All checks passed:

- ✅ **black**: All files properly formatted
- ✅ **ruff**: No linting errors
- ✅ **py_compile**: Valid Python syntax
- ✅ **CodeQL**: No security vulnerabilities detected

### Code Review Notes

One advisory comment about `datetime.utcnow()` being deprecated in Python 3.12. This is a codebase-wide pattern and should be addressed in a separate PR. Kept consistency with existing code.

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. ✅ Stop all extraction jobs
2. ✅ Backup database
3. ✅ Run deduplication script (dry-run first)
4. ✅ Apply migration
5. ✅ Verify index exists
6. ✅ Resume extraction jobs

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Analyze duplicates (dry-run)
python scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py --dry-run

# 2. Remove duplicates (interactive)
python scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py

# 3. Apply migration
alembic upgrade 20251025_add_uq_articles_url

# 4. Verify index
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename='articles' AND indexname='uq_articles_url';"
```

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Medium → Low (after mitigation)

**Mitigations:**
- Pre-flight duplicate check prevents corruption
- CONCURRENTLY index creation minimizes locking
- Comprehensive testing validates behavior
- Clear rollback procedure documented
- No application code changes required

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate articles at database level
2. **Reliability**: ON CONFLICT clauses work correctly
3. **Performance**: Index may improve query performance on URL lookups
4. **Maintainability**: Schema expectations clearly documented

### Potential Issues (and Mitigations)

1. **Issue**: Duplicates exist in production
   - **Mitigation**: Deduplication script with dry-run analysis

2. **Issue**: Index creation locks table
   - **Mitigation**: CONCURRENTLY keyword (PostgreSQL)

3. **Issue**: Extraction fails after migration
   - **Mitigation**: Rollback procedure + existing code already uses ON CONFLICT

## Files Changed

- `alembic/versions/20251025_add_unique_articles_url.py` - New migration
- `scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py` - Enhanced script (238 lines)
- `tests/alembic/test_articles_url_constraint.py` - New tests (417 lines)
- `docs/migrations/articles_url_deduplication.md` - New documentation (340 lines)
