# Implementation Summary: Article URL Deduplication

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive solution for GitHub Issue #105 to enforce article URL deduplication at the database level.

## Implementation Date

2025-10-25

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (`alembic/versions/20251025_add_unique_articles_url.py`)

- Creates unique index `uq_articles_url` on `articles.url` column
- Uses `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for PostgreSQL (non-blocking)
- Includes pre-flight duplicate detection that fails migration if duplicates exist
- Supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Fully tested upgrade and downgrade paths

**Key Features:**
- Non-blocking for production deployments
- Safety check prevents corruption
- Clear error messages guide manual remediation

### 2. Deduplication Script (`scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py`)

Enhanced existing script with:
- Comprehensive logging via Python logging module
- Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) for safe analysis
- Interactive confirmation prompts
- Command-line arguments (`--yes`, `--create-index`)
- Support for both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Idempotent operation (safe to re-run)

**Deduplication Policy:**
- Keeps: Most recent article (by `extracted_at` timestamp)
- Deletes: Older duplicates and their child records

### 3. Test Suite (`tests/alembic/test_articles_url_constraint.py`)

Comprehensive integration tests covering:
- Migration success on clean database
- Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- Migration fails when duplicates exist (safety check)
- ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING works correctly
- Deduplication script dry-run mode
- Proper rollback via downgrade

**Test Statistics:**
- 6 test cases
- Both positive and negative scenarios
- Integration tests with real SQLite database

### 4. Documentation (`docs/migrations/articles_url_deduplication.md`)

Complete production runbook including:
- Pre-migration requirements
- Step-by-step deployment procedure
- Verification steps
- Monitoring guidance
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Rollback procedures

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing ✅

All manual tests passed:

1. **Migration Success**
   ```bash
   ✓ alembic upgrade head
   ✓ Index created: uq_articles_url
   ```

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   ```bash
   ✓ ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING silently ignores duplicates
   ✓ Only first article retained
   ```

3. **Safety Check**
   ```bash
   ✓ Migration fails with duplicates
   ✓ Clear error message provided
   ```

4. **Rollback**
   ```bash
   ✓ alembic downgrade removes index
   ✓ No data loss during rollback
   ```

### Code Quality ✅

All checks passed:

- ✅ **black**: All files properly formatted
- ✅ **ruff**: No linting errors
- ✅ **py_compile**: Valid Python syntax
- ✅ **CodeQL**: No security vulnerabilities detected

### Code Review Notes

One advisory comment about `datetime.utcnow()` being deprecated in Python 3.12. This is a codebase-wide pattern and should be addressed in a separate PR. Kept consistency with existing code.

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. ✅ Stop all extraction jobs
2. ✅ Backup database
3. ✅ Run deduplication script (dry-run first)
4. ✅ Apply migration
5. ✅ Verify index exists
6. ✅ Resume extraction jobs

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Analyze duplicates (dry-run)
python scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py --dry-run

# 2. Remove duplicates (interactive)
python scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py

# 3. Apply migration
alembic upgrade 20251025_add_uq_articles_url

# 4. Verify index
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename='articles' AND indexname='uq_articles_url';"
```

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Medium → Low (after mitigation)

**Mitigations:**
- Pre-flight duplicate check prevents corruption
- CONCURRENTLY index creation minimizes locking
- Comprehensive testing validates behavior
- Clear rollback procedure documented
- No application code changes required

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate articles at database level
2. **Reliability**: ON CONFLICT clauses work correctly
3. **Performance**: Index may improve query performance on URL lookups
4. **Maintainability**: Schema expectations clearly documented

### Potential Issues (and Mitigations)

1. **Issue**: Duplicates exist in production
   - **Mitigation**: Deduplication script with dry-run analysis

2. **Issue**: Index creation locks table
   - **Mitigation**: CONCURRENTLY keyword (PostgreSQL)

3. **Issue**: Extraction fails after migration
   - **Mitigation**: Rollback procedure + existing code already uses ON CONFLICT

## Files Changed

- `alembic/versions/20251025_add_unique_articles_url.py` - New migration
- `scripts/fix_article_duplicates.py` - Enhanced script (238 lines)
- `tests/alembic/test_articles_url_constraint.py` - New tests (417 lines)
- `docs/migrations/articles_url_deduplication.md` - New documentation (340 lines)

**Total:** 4 files, ~995 lines added/modified

## Verification Checklist

Before closing issue:

- [x] Migration file created and tested
- [x] Deduplication script enhanced and tested
- [x] Test suite created and passing
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Code formatted and linted
- [x] Security scan passed
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] Rollback tested
- [ ] Production deployment completed (pending)
- [ ] Post-deployment monitoring (pending)

## Next Steps

1. **Code Review**: Request review from team members
2. **Staging Test**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **Production Deployment**: Follow runbook in docs/migrations/
4. **Monitoring**: Watch extraction jobs for first 24 hours
5. **Close Issue**: Mark GitHub Issue #105 as resolved
