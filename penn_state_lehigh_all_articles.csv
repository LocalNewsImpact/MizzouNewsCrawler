For the first time ever, Whitehall-Coplay School District will have a mascot.

The Big Z moniker is an homage to the school’s nickname, Zephyrs, which was the name of a train that once ran through Whitehall Township.

The mascot is a cartoon-like character with a narrow head shaped like the front of a train engine. It wears bib overalls in the school colors: maroon and gold.
